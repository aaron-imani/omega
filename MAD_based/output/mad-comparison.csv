Fixes a bug in the equals method by adding a type check to prevent null pointer exceptions and ensure correct equality comparisons.","fix: Improve equals() method null handling
This change improves the equals() method's null handling by introducing an instance check, preventing NullPointerExceptions when comparing against null objects.","fix: Verify object type in equals method
Prevents incorrect equality comparison by checking if the object is an instance of ParameterizedType.","fix: Improve equals method in SimpleParameterizedType
Fix the equals method to correctly handle null objects and instances of ParameterizedType. This change ensures that the method behaves correctly in all scenarios, improving the overall reliability of the SimpleParameterizedType class.",Fix: Update equals method in SimpleParameterizedType class The equals method in the SimpleParameterizedType class has been updated. The condition checking if the object is null has been replaced with a condition checking if the object is an instance of ParameterizedType. This change ensures a more accurate comparison between this parameterized type and another object.

Fixes incorrect null validation in `AbstractHTTPServlet` by using `originalRemoteAddr` instead of `newRemoteAddr`, ensuring the `_X-Forwarded-For_` header is properly considered. This change resolves the issue where `newRemoteAddr` was never assigned.","fix: Validate against originalRemoteAddr instead of newRemoteAddr
This change corrects the validation logic in `AbstractHTTPServlet` by using `originalRemoteAddr` instead of `newRemoteAddr`, which previously caused the `X-Forwarded-For` header to be ignored. This fix ensures that the header is now properly considered, addressing the issue of `newRemoteAddr` never being assigned.","fix: Assign newRemoteAddr correctly in AbstractHTTPServlet
Using originalRemoteAddr instead of newRemoteAddr for not null validation, ensuring the X-Forwarded-For header is considered.","fix: Fix newRemoteAddr assignment
Fixes the issue where newRemoteAddr was never assigned due to incorrect null validation. The variable originalRemoteAddr is now correctly used for null validation before assignment.",Fix: Correct condition check in AbstractHTTPServlet The condition in the AbstractHTTPServlet.java file has been modified to check if 'originalRemoteAddr' is not null instead of 'newRemoteAddr'. This change ensures that the correct variable is checked before proceeding with the method execution.
