",There is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff),"Title: [BEAM-10402] Enable checkerframework globally
Body: Instead of opting out whole modules now only existing classes are opted out of type checking. This has the following benefits:

 - New code will be checked, even in modules that are not yet passing.
 - Code won't as easily backslide in modules that were partially fixed.
 - It will produce much more manageable incremental work, and limitless starter bugs!

I produced the needed warnings (merged in other PRs) by removing the flag and then repeating the following, more or less:

```
./gradlew compileJava compileTestJava --continue 2>&1 | tee ~/tmp/gradle.log
 
cat ~/tmp/gradle.log \
    | grep -e ""$PWD""'.*error:.*' \
    | cut -d : -f 1 \
    | sort -u \
    | xargs grep -L -e '^@SuppressWarnings' \
    | xargs sed -E -i '' 's/^(public +)?((abstract|final) +)?(class|interface)/@SuppressWarnings(""nullness"") &/'
  
./gradlew spotlessApply
```

There are two ways to still suppress type checking, arguments to `applyJavaNature`:

1. `generatedClassPatterns` to exclude various generated code that is not annotated with nullness types
2. `classesTriggerCheckerBugs` a map from classes which cannot be analyzed to their checkerframework bug URL",Could not figure out the most important file(s).,3.69,18.9,19.52

The problem is due to the fact that when getTotalBufferSize is called the segment has already been desallocated. The reason being that the segment has been put twice in the queue of the CacheBucket.
I tracked down the problem to CompactionTask.runMayThrow which trigger 2 calls to the close method of BigTableScanner.

This commit fixes the ApacheDS class to correctly handle LDIF file loading. The method loadLdif(File ldifFile) was modified to correctly handle the loading of LDIF files into the directory service. The method now correctly logs the result of loading the LDIF file and skips loading the file if it has already been loaded. This change ensures that the directory service correctly handles LDIF file loading and prevents duplicate loading of files.","

## What is the purpose of the change

Currently, recovery with rescaled channel state is failing. This PR enhances `StateAssignmentOperation` to reassignment channel state and create a channel state mapping, where channels before rescaling are mapped to channels after rescaling.

## Brief change log

- Refactors `StateAssignmentOperation` in preparation. In particular, it adds a two pass approach such that vertex may assign state of other vertexes.
- Adds `ChannelStateRescaler` to define rescaling behavior of in-flight data.
- Adds two properties to `StreamPartitioner` to return the `ChannelStateRescaler` for upstream and downstream side.
- Add upstream and downstream `ChannelStateRescaler`s to `JobEdge`, such that it is accessible to `StateAssignmentOperation`.
- Adding channel reassignment to `StateAssignmentOperation`.


## Verifying this change

Added unit tests. The final rescale PRs will also adapt `UnalignedCheckpointITCase` to cover rescaling.

",There is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff),"Title: [FLINK-21400] Store attempt numbers outside ExecutionGraph
Body: Introduces a data structure to store the attempt numbers outside the ExecutionGraph. It's really just a simple Map<ExecutionVertexID, Integer> which ties a specific vertex+subtask to an attempt count.

Counts are set when an execution is registered at the EG, and retrieved when the ExecutionVertex creates a new Execution. The current attempt count is also still stored in the Execution, making the change less invasive (for example, resetForNewExecution continues to work without modifications).


One thing is that, as is, the semantics when it comes to rescaling are a bit funky.
ScaleUp:
If you begin with p=1 and an attempt count of 4, and then rescale to p=2, then what should the attempt count be for both subtasks?
In this version the attempt count for subtask 1 would be retained, while subtask 2 starts at 0.
Setting both to 0 would also make sense, but if we downscale again to p=1 then it would be nice if the attempt count had some relation to the original count.
Alternatively we could try to derive the attempt count for subtask 2 from other subtasks; in this example the obvious choice would be 2, because we're just replicating subtask 1.

ScaleDown:
The main issue arises when scaling down where the subtask with the largest index has the highest attempt count; currently this count would be lost. So you have p=2, and subtask 2 has an attempt count of 4, and now you scale down to p=1. The attempt count would now be solely determined by subtask 1, although we in essence just merged the two.


Overall, I don't think resetting attempt counts to 0 is an option, because they can be used to gauge the health of a vertex, and we'd run into collisions within metrics if we ever re-use a subtask+attempt combination.

The current approach is by far the simplest, and is the only option iff we want to adhere to these rules:
* every combination of subtask + attempt count is only used once

The null check prevents potential NullPointerExceptions when trying to get the client anchor of a shape that does not have a VML shape associated with it.,4,4,4,4,"fix: Fixed VML shape visibility and anchor retrieval
This commit fixes the visibility check for VML shapes and the retrieval of client anchors. The `isVisible()` method now correctly checks the style attribute for 'visibility:visible' and the `getClientAnchor()` method returns the client anchor position from the VML shape. These changes improve the accuracy and reliability of VML shape handling in XSSFComment.","

This commit introduces a new method getStreamResult to allow for custom stream operations. The method is designed to return a stream result for writing to a given output stream. This change enables users to override the default stream result and use it for specific purposes, such as PDF generation using Apache Fop. The XSLTJaxbProvider class has been modified to include this new method.","
