This commit introduces the ability to set a desired OS family type and evaluate if the current OS matches it. The setFamily method allows setting the OS family type, and the eval method determines if the current OS matches the set type. The OS family type is set using a string parameter, which is converted to lowercase for consistency. The eval method uses system properties to determine the current OS and compare it with the set family type.","

Java 11 introduces additional overloads for the toArray method with one parameter.,"Refactor: Enhance convertArray method in ByteBuddyUtils.java The convertArray method in ByteBuddyUtils.java has been refactored to improve its functionality. The method now converts a collection to an array, and if the array is of primitive types, it converts the array of boxed objects to an array of unboxed objects. This change enhances the method's ability to handle arrays of different types and improves the overall functionality of the ByteBuddyUtils class.","fix: Disambiguate method filter for toArray in ByteBuddyUtils
This commit fixes the method filter for toArray in ByteBuddyUtils to handle the additional overloads introduced in Java 11. The filter is updated to specify the exact method signature, ensuring the correct method is selected. This change is necessary to avoid ambiguity and ensure correct behavior in Java 11 environments.","

",There is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff),"Title: [BEAM-10402] Enable checkerframework globally
Body: Instead of opting out whole modules now only existing classes are opted out of type checking. This has the following benefits:

 - New code will be checked, even in modules that are not yet passing.
 - Code won't as easily backslide in modules that were partially fixed.
 - It will produce much more manageable incremental work, and limitless starter bugs!

I produced the needed warnings (merged in other PRs) by removing the flag and then repeating the following, more or less:

```
./gradlew compileJava compileTestJava --continue 2>&1 | tee ~/tmp/gradle.log
 
cat ~/tmp/gradle.log \

./gradlew spotlessApply
```

The problem is due to the fact that when getTotalBufferSize is called the segment has already been desallocated. The reason being that the segment has been put twice in the queue of the CacheBucket.

Issue ID: CASSANDRA-13594
Title: Use an ExecutorService for repair commands instead of new Thread(..).start()
Body: Currently when starting a new repair, we create a new Thread and start it immediately
It would be nice to be able to 1) limit the number of threads and 2) reject starting new repair commands if we are already running too many.

Fixes the error message thrown when attempting to alter a materialized view with a default_time_to_live. The new error message is more informative and provides context about why default_time_to_live must be set to zero for materialized views, referencing CASSANDRA-12868.

Previously, the method would apply the password hashing algorithm to the 'userPassword' attribute if it was present in the modification items. Now, the method checks if the modification operation is to remove the attribute and skips the operation if so. This change enhances the functionality of the method by preventing unnecessary operations.","fix: Handle remove attribute operation in PasswordHashingInterceptor
This commit fixes an issue in the PasswordHashingInterceptor where it was not handling the remove attribute operation correctly. It now checks if the modification operation is a remove attribute operation and skips hashing the password in that case. This ensures that the interceptor behaves correctly when a remove attribute operation is performed on the 'userPassword' attribute.","

## What is the purpose of the change

Currently, recovery with rescaled channel state is failing. This PR enhances `StateAssignmentOperation` to reassignment channel state and create a channel state mapping, where channels before rescaling are mapped to channels after rescaling.

## Brief change log

- Refactors `StateAssignmentOperation` in preparation. In particular, it adds a two pass approach such that vertex may assign state of other vertexes.
- Adds `ChannelStateRescaler` to define rescaling behavior of in-flight data.
- Adds two properties to `StreamPartitioner` to return the `ChannelStateRescaler` for upstream and downstream side.
- Add upstream and downstream `ChannelStateRescaler`s to `JobEdge`, such that it is accessible to `StateAssignmentOperation`.
- Adding channel reassignment to `StateAssignmentOperation`.


## Verifying this change

Added unit tests. The final rescale PRs will also adapt `UnalignedCheckpointITCase` to cover rescaling.

",There is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff),"Title: [FLINK-21400] Store attempt numbers outside ExecutionGraph
Body: Introduces a data structure to store the attempt numbers outside the ExecutionGraph. It's really just a simple Map<ExecutionVertexID, Integer> which ties a specific vertex+subtask to an attempt count.

Counts are set when an execution is registered at the EG, and retrieved when the ExecutionVertex creates a new Execution. The current attempt count is also still stored in the Execution, making the change less invasive (for example, resetForNewExecution continues to work without modifications).


One thing is that, as is, the semantics when it comes to rescaling are a bit funky.
ScaleUp:
If you begin with p=1 and an attempt count of 4, and then rescale to p=2, then what should the attempt count be for both subtasks?
In this version the attempt count for subtask 1 would be retained, while subtask 2 starts at 0.
Setting both to 0 would also make sense, but if we downscale again to p=1 then it would be nice if the attempt count had some relation to the original count.
Alternatively we could try to derive the attempt count for subtask 2 from other subtasks; in this example the obvious choice would be 2, because we're just replicating subtask 1.

ScaleDown:
The main issue arises when scaling down where the subtask with the largest index has the highest attempt count; currently this count would be lost. So you have p=2, and subtask 2 has an attempt count of 4, and now you scale down to p=1. The attempt count would now be solely determined by subtask 1, although we in essence just merged the two.


Overall, I don't think resetting attempt counts to 0 is an option, because they can be used to gauge the health of a vertex, and we'd run into collisions within metrics if we ever re-use a subtask+attempt combination.

The current approach is by far the simplest, and is the only option iff we want to adhere to these rules:
* every combination of subtask + attempt count is only used once
* the attempt counts for a given subtask over time always form a continuous series starting at 0

This commit refactors the WALRecord class by introducing a new record type, HEADER_RECORD, and adding assertions to ensure the correctness of the position and size methods.

These changes improve the internal structure of the class, making it easier to understand and maintain.","

This change enhances the file matching logic to be more comprehensive and accurate.","

The method now filters the supported cipher suites based on the provided include/exclude filters. The constant list DEFAULT_CIPHERSUITE_FILTERS_INCLUDE has been removed and replaced with a call to Collections.emptyList(). This change simplifies the code and makes it easier to understand.","refactor: Remove default cipher suite filters
Removed the default cipher suite filters and replaced it with an empty list when no filters are provided. This change simplifies the logic of filtering cipher suites and makes it more flexible for users to configure their own filters. The functionality of the SSLUtils class remains the same, but the implementation is more efficient and easier to understand.","
