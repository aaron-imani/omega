The change does not affect the underlying purpose of the method.\n\n**How-to-use:** The usage of the method remains the same. The method is still used to set up the test case by getting a reference to the proxy manager and setting up the configuration for the test.\n\n**How-it-is-done:** The method still sets up the test by getting the proxy manager and setting the configuration for the test. The change only affects the specific configuration being used, not the overall process.\n\n**Property:** The method still sets up the test by getting a reference to the proxy manager and setting the configuration for the test. The change does not affect the pre-conditions or post-conditions of the method.\n\nIn summary, the changes do not significantly alter the behavior of the method, but rather modify the specific configuration being used. The method still serves the same purpose and is used in the same way.Method private ProxyConfiguration getProxyConfiguration() throws ComponentLookupException is newly added by this git diff.\nIts summaries are: \nWhat: gets the configuration for the proxy .\nWhy: sets up a proxy configuration for a Maven project, defining a repository cache path and a remote repository .\nHow-to-use: This method is used to configure the proxy settings for a maven repository .\nHow-it-is-done: sets up a proxy configuration for a maven repository with a local cache and a remote repository .\nProperty: returns a proxy configuration object with a repository cache path and a remote repository .\n\n\nMethod private ProxyConfiguration getTestConfiguration() throws ComponentLookupException is deleted by this git diff.\nIts summaries are: \nWhat: sets up a test configuration for a proxy repository .\nWhy: method to create a test configuration for a proxy repository, used for testing purposes .\nHow-to-use: This method is used to set up a test configuration for a Maven proxy repository.\nHow-it-is-done: sets up a test configuration for a proxy repository .\nProperty: returns a test configuration for a maven proxy repository .\n\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe functionality of the modified classes remains the same before and after the changes.\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nHere is the associated pull request(s):\nThere is no pull request associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nEND OF COMMIT CONTEXT\n\nYour commit message: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"type\": \"fix\",\n    \"subject\": \"Update test configuration to use getProxyConfiguration()\",\n    \"body\": \"This commit updates the test configuration in DefaultProxyManagerTest and LegacyProxyManagerTest to use the getProxyConfiguration() method instead of getTestConfiguration().

Instead, it will return a list containing two coder arguments: `elementCoder` and `windowCoder`.\n\n**Why:** The reason for this change is to provide the coder arguments for the Beam transform, which is necessary for processing the data. The original method returned an empty list, which would not be useful for the transform.\n\n**How-to-use:** The method is still used to specify the coder arguments for a Beam transform. However, now it is expected to be used with two coder arguments, `elementCoder` and `windowCoder`, which should be provided when calling this method.\n\n**How-it-is-done:** The method now returns a list containing two coder arguments, `elementCoder` and `windowCoder`, instead of an empty list.\n\n**Property:** The method still returns a list of coder arguments, but now it returns a non-empty list containing the specified coder arguments. The pre-condition is that `elementCoder` and `windowCoder` should be valid coder arguments for the Beam transform. The post-condition is that the method returns a list of coder arguments that can be used for the transform.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe functionality of the modified

The method convertArray(TypeDescriptor<?> type) now considers the possibility of converting an array of objects to an array of primitives if the array contains only primitives.

The new pruning pattern will be added to the list of patterns, which will exclude classes from the \"org.checkerframework\" package and its subpackages.\n\n**Property:** The property of the method remains the same, it's still a JUnit test method that tests the GCP API surface by creating an instance of `ApiSurface` and specifying a set of allowed classes. The new pruning pattern will be added to the list of allowed classes, which will affect the property of the method by excluding classes from the \"org.checkerframework\" package and its subpackages.Method public void testGcpCoreApiSurface() throws Exception is modified by this git diff.\nThe method summaries before the commit are:\nWhat: test the gcp core api surface by checking if it only contains allowed classes .\nWhy: tests the GCP core API surface by checking if it only contains allowed classes .\nHow-to-use: This is a JUnit test method that tests the GCP Core API Surface by verifying that it only includes allowed classes and excludes unwanted ones.\nHow-it-is-done: tests the GCP Core API surface by checking if it only includes allowed classes and excludes others .\nProperty: tests the GCP Core API surface by checking if it contains only the allowed classes .\n\n\nHere's how each aspect of the method will change after the changes are applied:\n\n**What:** The function will now test the GCP core API surface by checking if it only contains allowed classes, including the newly added classes from the checkerframework.\n\n**Why:** The reason for adding this new class remains the same, to test the GCP core API surface by checking if it only contains allowed classes.\n\n**How-to-use:** The usage of the method remains the same, it's still a JUnit test method that tests the GCP Core API Surface by verifying that it only includes allowed classes and excludes unwanted ones.\n\n**How-it-is-done:** The method will now also include the newly added classes from the checkerframework in its test, in addition to the existing allowed classes.

The addition of the Checker Framework's packages and classes to the exclusion list is to further refine the test's scope.\n\n**How-to-use:** The usage of this method remains the same: it's a unit test for the DirectRunner API surface in Apache Beam. The addition of the new pattern to exclude does not change the way the method is used.\n\n**How-it-is-done:** The method will still test the DirectRunner API surface by checking if it only exposes the expected packages and classes. The new pattern will be added to the existing list of patterns to exclude, which will be used to prune the API surface.\n\n**Property:** The method's property remains the same: it tests the DirectRunner API surface by checking if it only exposes the expected packages and classes. The addition of the new pattern does not change the method's property, but it does refine the test's scope by excluding more packages and classes.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe functionality of the modified classes remains the same before and after the changes.\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nHere is the associated pull request(s):\nTitle: [BEAM-10402] Enable checkerframework globally\nBody: Instead of opting out whole modules now only existing classes are opted out of type checking. This has the following benefits:\r\n\r\n - New code will be checked, even in modules that are not yet passing.\r\n - Code won't as easily backslide in modules that were partially fixed.\r\n - It will produce much more manageable incremental work, and limitless starter bugs!\r\n\r\nI produced the needed warnings (merged in other PRs) by removing the flag and then repeating the following, more or less:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./gradlew compileJava compileTestJava --continue 2>&1 | tee ~/tmp/gradle.log\r\n \r\ncat ~/tmp/gradle.log \\\r\n    | grep -e \"$PWD\"'.*error:.*' \\\r\n    | cut -d : -f 1 \\\r\n    | sort -u \\\r\n    | xargs grep -L -e '^@SuppressWarnings' \\\r\n    | xargs sed -E -i '' 's/^(public +)?((abstract|final) +)?(class|interface)/@SuppressWarnings(\"nullness\") &/'\r\n  \r\n./gradlew spotlessApply\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to still suppress type checking, arguments to `applyJavaNature`:\r\n\r\n1. `generatedClassPatterns` to exclude various generated code that is not annotated with nullness types\r\n2. `classesTriggerCheckerBugs` a map from classes which cannot be analyzed to their checkerframework bug URL\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, recovery with rescaled channel state is failing. This PR enhances `StateAssignmentOperation` to reassignment channel state and create a channel state mapping, where channels before rescaling are mapped to channels after rescaling.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Refactors `StateAssignmentOperation` in preparation. In particular, it adds a two pass approach such that vertex may assign state of other vertexes.\r\n- Adds `ChannelStateRescaler` to define rescaling behavior of in-flight data.\r\n- Adds two properties to `StreamPartitioner` to return the `ChannelStateRescaler` for upstream and downstream side.\r\n- Add upstream and downstream `ChannelStateRescaler`s to `JobEdge`, such that it is accessible to `StateAssignmentOperation`.\r\n- Adding channel reassignment to `StateAssignmentOperation`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests. The final rescale PRs will also adapt `UnalignedCheckpointITCase` to cover rescaling.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / **not documented**) (not finished yet)\n\nEND OF COMMIT CONTEXT\n\nYour commit message: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"type\": \"fix\",\n    \"subject\": \"Fix ObjectInputStream serialization to handle classloader-specific serialization\",\n    \"body\": \"This commit fixes the ObjectInputStream serialization to handle serialization and deserialization of objects in a classloader-specific manner.

It's really just a simple Map<ExecutionVertexID, Integer> which ties a specific vertex+subtask to an attempt count.\r\n\r\nCounts are set when an execution is registered at the EG, and retrieved when the ExecutionVertex creates a new Execution. The current attempt count is also still stored in the Execution, making the change less invasive (for example, resetForNewExecution continues to work without modifications).\r\n\r\n\r\nOne thing is that, as is, the semantics when it comes to rescaling are a bit funky.\r\nScaleUp:\r\nIf you begin with p=1 and an attempt count of 4, and then rescale to p=2, then what should the attempt count be for both subtasks?\r\nIn this version the attempt count for subtask 1 would be retained, while subtask 2 starts at 0.\r\nSetting both to 0 would also make sense, but if we downscale again to p=1 then it would be nice if the attempt count had some relation to the original count.\r\nAlternatively we could try to derive the attempt count for subtask 2 from other subtasks; in this example the obvious choice would be 2, because we're just replicating subtask 1.\r\n\r\nScaleDown:\r\nThe main issue arises when scaling down where the subtask with the largest index has the highest attempt count; currently this count would be lost. So you have p=2, and subtask 2 has an attempt count of 4, and now you scale down to p=1. The attempt count would now be solely determined by subtask 1, although we in essence just merged the two.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, I don't think resetting attempt counts to 0 is an option, because they can be used to gauge the health of a vertex, and we'd run into collisions within metrics if we ever re-use a subtask+attempt combination.\r\n\r\nThe current approach is by far the simplest, and is the only option iff we want to adhere to these rules:\r\n* every combination of subtask + attempt count is only used once\r\n* the attempt counts for a given subtask over time always form a continuous series starting at 0\r\n\r\nBut I'm quite interested in what other people think about this.\n\nEND OF COMMIT CONTEXT\n\nYour commit message: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"type\": \"fix\",\n    \"subject\": \"Verify job execution and throw AssertionError if job failed\",\n    \"body\": \"This commit fixes the YARNFileReplicationITCase class by adding a check for the job's execution status.

The leader is a visual element that is used to separate the block\nHow-it-is-done: adds a leader to a block of text in a document, which can be a rule, space, or dots .\nProperty: adds a leader to the document, which can be a rule, dots, or whitespace, and adjusts the layout accordingly .\n\n\nWhat: The function will still add a leader to the current block of text, but it will now also consider the remaining width of the line when determining the leader length. The function will now have more conditions to check when determining the leader length.\n\nWhy: The function will still add a leader to the current line of text, but it will now also consider the remaining width of the line when determining the leader length. This is to ensure that the leader does not overflow the line.\n\nHow-to-use: The method will still be used to add a leader to a block of text in a document. The user will still specify the pattern, length, and alignment of the leader. However, the user will now also need to consider the remaining width of the line when determining the leader length.\n\nHow-it-is-done: The function will still add a leader to a block of text in a document, but it will now also consider the remaining width of the line when determining the leader length. The function will now have more conditions to check when determining the leader length.\n\nProperty: The function will still add a leader to the document, which can be a rule, dots, or whitespace, and adjusts the layout accordingly. However, the function will now also consider the remaining width of the line when determining the leader length, which may affect the layout of the document.\n\nIn summary, the changes will add more conditions to check when determining the leader length, and will consider the remaining width of the line when determining the leader length.

Do not repeat the type in the subject.\n- The body is optional but strongly recommended. It should comprehensively provide additional relevant contextual information about **all** the changes made and/or justifications/motivations behind them. It must be written as detailed as possible. If you do not provide a body, you should use an empty string for its value. You are strongly encouraged to provide a body based on all the provided context.\n- Body should not include code blocks or snippets.\n- Do not write generic/uniformative/useless sentences in body. Provide only important and relevant information.\n- The type is the software maintenance activity type of the commit that should be determined based on the commit changes, commit message body and subject. The type must be exactly one of the following: feat, fix, style, refactor.  No other values are acceptable. The definitions of these activities are given below:\nfeat: introducing NEW features into the system. (feat is short for feature)\nfix: FIXING faults or software bugs.\nstyle: code FORMAT changes such as fixing redundant white-space, adding missing semi-colons, and similar changes.\nrefactor: changes made to the INTERNAL STRUCTURE of software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behavior.\n- Type should not be repeated in the subject. Remember, type should be determined based on the commit changes, commit message body and subject.\n"}, {"role": "human", "content": "START OF COMMIT CONTEXT\n\nThe Git diff:\n\ndiff --git a/examples/embedding/java/embedding/intermediate/ExampleStamp.java b/examples/embedding/java/embedding/intermediate/ExampleStamp.java\nindex 42ea34137..860a75401 100644\n--- a/examples/embedding/java/embedding/intermediate/ExampleStamp.java\n+++ b/examples/embedding/java/embedding/intermediate/ExampleStamp.java\n@@ -115,7 +115,7 @@ public class ExampleStamp {\n \n             //Setup output file\n             File xsltfile = new File(baseDir, \"xml/xslt/projectteam2fo.xsl\");\n-            File iffile = new File(outDir, \"team.at.xml\");\n+            File iffile = new File(outDir, \"team.if.xml\");\n             File stampxsltfile = new File(baseDir, \"xml/xslt/ifstamp.xsl\");\n             File pdffile = new File(outDir, \"ResultIFStamped.pdf\");\n             System.out.println(\"Intermediate file : \" + iffile.getCanonicalPath());\n\n\nChanged files relative importance:\nThere is only one changed file in this commit.
