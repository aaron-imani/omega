(feat is short for feature)\nfix: FIXING faults or software bugs.\nstyle: code FORMAT changes such as fixing redundant white-space, adding missing semi-colons, and similar changes.\nrefactor: changes made to the INTERNAL STRUCTURE of software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behavior.\n- Type should not be repeated in the subject. Remember, type should be determined based on the commit changes, commit message body and subject.\n"}, {"role": "human", "content": "\n\n### Summaries of Affected Method(s)\nThe code changes in this git diff are not located within any method body.\n\n#### Reading Instructions\n\nThe reading instructions is included in the content if this card.\n\n#### Trustworthiness\n\nThis information may be correct, but it is not guaranteed.
