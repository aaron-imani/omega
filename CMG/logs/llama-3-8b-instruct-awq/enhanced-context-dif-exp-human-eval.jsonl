It checks for various configuration options, such as partitioner, request scheduler,\nWhy: This is a configuration validation method for Cassandra, a NoSQL database. It checks various configuration options and throws exceptions if they are invalid or not set correctly\nHow-to-use: This is a configuration validation method for Cassandra, a NoSQL database. It checks the validity of various configuration options and settings, such as partitioner,\nHow-it-is-done: this method applies the configuration settings to the cassandra node .\nProperty: This method applies the configuration settings to the Cassandra node. It checks for various configuration options and throws exceptions if they are invalid or missing. The method also\n\n\nHere's how each aspect of the method will change after the changes are applied:\n\n**What:** The method will still apply the configuration settings from a Config object to the Cassandra node. However, the condition for checking `cdc_enabled` will be changed from `conf.cdc_enabled != null` to `conf.cdc_enabled == true`.\n\n**Why:** The method will still be a configuration validation method for Cassandra, a NoSQL database. However, the reason for throwing an exception for `cdc_enabled` will be changed from \"cdc_enabled is missing and -Dcassandra.storagedir is not set\" to \"cdc_enabled is true\".\n\n**How-to-use:** The method will still be used to apply the configuration settings to the Cassandra node. However, the condition for checking `cdc_enabled` will be changed from `conf.cdc_enabled != null` to `conf.cdc_enabled == true`.\n\n**How-it-is-done:** The method will still apply the configuration settings to the Cassandra node. However, the condition for checking `cdc_enabled` will be changed from `conf.cdc_enabled != null` to `conf.cdc_enabled == true`.\n\n**Property:** The method will still apply the configuration settings to the Cassandra node. However, the property of the method will be changed from \"cdc_enabled is missing and -Dcassandra.storagedir is not set\" to \"cdc_enabled is true\".\n\nIn summary, the changes will affect the condition for checking `cdc_enabled` from `conf.cdc_enabled != null` to `conf.cdc_enabled == true`.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe code changes in this git diff are not located within any class body.

Instead, it will test the authentication and authorization of a LDAP connection.\n\n**Why:** The original purpose of the method was to test the confidentiality of a LDAP connection. However, with the changes, the method will now test the authentication and authorization of a LDAP connection.\n\n**How-to-use:** The method will still be a JUnit test case for testing the authentication and authorization of a LDAP connection. However, the method will no longer test the confidentiality of a LDAP connection.\n\n**How-it-is-done:** The method will still cover several scenarios such as searching, creating, modifying, renaming, and deleting entries. However, the method will no longer test the confidentiality of a LDAP connection.\n\n**Property:** The method will still be a test method for ldap operations. However, the method will no longer test the confidentiality of a LDAP connection.

Instead, it will not set any specific requirement for confidentiality.\n\nWhy: The reason for setting the confidentiality required flag to true is removed. The method will no longer provide a specific configuration for confidentiality.\n\nHow-to-use: The method will still configure the LDAP server, but it will not provide any specific configuration for confidentiality. The user of this method will need to consider other ways to configure the LDAP server for confidentiality.\n\nHow-it-is-done: The method will still configure the LDAP server, but it will not set the confidentiality required flag to true.

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, recovery with rescaled channel state is failing. This PR enhances `StateAssignmentOperation` to reassignment channel state and create a channel state mapping, where channels before rescaling are mapped to channels after rescaling.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Refactors `StateAssignmentOperation` in preparation. In particular, it adds a two pass approach such that vertex may assign state of other vertexes.\r\n- Adds `ChannelStateRescaler` to define rescaling behavior of in-flight data.\r\n- Adds two properties to `StreamPartitioner` to return the `ChannelStateRescaler` for upstream and downstream side.\r\n- Add upstream and downstream `ChannelStateRescaler`s to `JobEdge`, such that it is accessible to `StateAssignmentOperation`.\r\n- Adding channel reassignment to `StateAssignmentOperation`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests. The final rescale PRs will also adapt `UnalignedCheckpointITCase` to cover rescaling.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

It's really just a simple Map<ExecutionVertexID, Integer> which ties a specific vertex+subtask to an attempt count.\r\n\r\nCounts are set when an execution is registered at the EG, and retrieved when the ExecutionVertex creates a new Execution. The current attempt count is also still stored in the Execution, making the change less invasive (for example, resetForNewExecution continues to work without modifications).\r\n\r\n\r\nOne thing is that, as is, the semantics when it comes to rescaling are a bit funky.\r\nScaleUp:\r\nIf you begin with p=1 and an attempt count of 4, and then rescale to p=2, then what should the attempt count be for both subtasks?\r\nIn this version the attempt count for subtask 1 would be retained, while subtask 2 starts at 0.\r\nSetting both to 0 would also make sense, but if we downscale again to p=1 then it would be nice if the attempt count had some relation to the original count.\r\nAlternatively we could try to derive the attempt count for subtask 2 from other subtasks; in this example the obvious choice would be 2, because we're just replicating subtask 1.\r\n\r\nScaleDown:\r\nThe main issue arises when scaling down where the subtask with the largest index has the highest attempt count; currently this count would be lost. So you have p=2, and subtask 2 has an attempt count of 4, and now you scale down to p=1. The attempt count would now be solely determined by subtask 1, although we in essence just merged the two.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, I don't think resetting attempt counts to 0 is an option, because they can be used to gauge the health of a vertex, and we'd run into collisions within metrics if we ever re-use a subtask+attempt combination.\r\n\r\nThe current approach is by far the simplest, and is the only option iff we want to adhere to these rules:\r\n* every combination of subtask + attempt count is only used once\r\n* the attempt counts for a given subtask over time always form a continuous series starting at 0\r\n\r\nBut I'm quite interested in what other people think about this.\n\nEND OF COMMIT CONTEXT\n\nYour commit message: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"type\": \"fix\",\n    \"subject\": \"Handle job failures in YARNFileReplicationITCase\",\n    \"body\": \"This commit fixes the YARNFileReplicationITCase by adding error handling code to the deployPerJob method.

Instead, it will test for resources with labels containing the phrase \"feeling a déjà vu\", \"not déjà vu\", and \"Déja Vü\". The method will also test the analyzer's ability to match accents.\n\n**Why:** The reason for the test remains the same: to test the configurable analyzer for case and accent insensitivity. However, the test now covers more scenarios, including the presence of the phrase \"not déjà vu\" and the analyzer's ability to match accents.\n\n**How-to-use:** The usage of the method remains the same: it's a test case for the configurable analyzer to check if it is case and accent insensitive. However, the test now covers more scenarios, so the user of the method needs to be aware of these additional cases.\n\n**How-it-is-done:** The method will now test the configurable analyzer by searching for resources with labels containing the phrases \"feeling a déjà vu\", \"not déjà vu\", and \"Déja Vü\". The method will also test the analyzer's ability to match accents. The test will be more comprehensive, covering more scenarios.\n\n**Property:** The method still tests the configurable analyzer for case and accent insensitivity, but now it covers more scenarios, including the presence of the phrase \"not déjà vu\" and the analyzer's ability to match accents. The pre-condition of the method remains the same: the configurable analyzer should be case and accent insensitive.

However, the method will no longer consider the language when creating a new engine.\n\n**Why:** The method will still retrieve or create an instance of the engine, but the reason for creating a new engine will be different. Previously, a new engine was created for a specific language, but now a new engine will be created without considering the language.\n\n**How-to-use:** The method will still be used to get an instance of Invocable from a pool of engines. However, the method will no longer require a language as a parameter, so the usage will be simpler.\n\n**How-it-is-done:** The method will still get an invocable engine from a pool, but now it will create a new engine without considering the language. This might affect the behavior of the method if the language is important for the engine's functionality.\n\n**Property:** The method will still return an invocable engine instance from a pool or creates a new one if not available. However, the method will no longer guarantee that the engine is specific to a language, so the post-condition of the method will be different.Method private Invocable createEngine() is newly added by this git diff.\nIts summaries are: \nWhat: creates and configures a scripting engine for a given language, loads the script library and functions, and initializes the engine with the necessary functions .\nWhy: creates an invocable script engine instance for the specified scripting language, loads the script library and functions, and initializes the engine .\nHow-to-use: This method is used to create an Invocable object from a ScriptEngine object, which is used to execute scripts in a Java application.\nHow-it-is-done: creates an invocable script engine instance for the specified scripting language , loads the script library and functions , and initializes the engine with the necessary functions .\nProperty: creates and initializes a script engine for the given scripting language, loads the script library and functions, and returns the invocable engine .\n\n\nMethod private static Invocable createEngine(String lang) is deleted by this git diff.\nIts summaries are: \nWhat: creates an invocable script engine instance for a given scripting language .\nWhy: creates an invocable script engine instance for the specified language and loads the necessary scripts and functions .\nHow-to-use: This method is used to create an Invocable object for a given scripting language.

However, the test will not be executed due to the annotation, so the test will not provide any insights into the log4j configuration.\n\nHow-to-use: The method will still test the log4j configuration in an osgi environment, but the test will not be executed due to the annotation. Therefore, the method will not provide any information on how to use the log4j configuration in an osgi environment.\n\nHow-it-is-done: The method will still test the log4j configuration in an osgi context by installing bundles, starting them, logging, and then verifying the output. However, the test will not be executed due to the annotation, so the method will not provide any information on how the log4j configuration is done in an osgi environment.\n\nProperty: The method will still test the log4j configuration in an osgi context by installing bundles and verifying the log output.

Instead of directly checking the size of the collection, users will now use the isEmpty() method to check if the collection is empty.\n\nHow-it-is-done: The method will still check if there are any exceptions stored in this object, but the way it does it will change.

If the session is null, it will return null immediately, instead of trying to get the product store id and potentially throwing a NullPointerException.\n\n**Property:** The method's property remains the same, but with the added consideration that it will return null if the session is null. The pre-condition is that the request object should be a valid HttpServletRequest, and the post-condition is that the method returns the product store id if it's present in the session or the website, or null if the session is null.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe summaries of the modified classes before and after the changes are described as follows:\nClass: ProductStoreWorker\nBefore Changes: **Returns** the main functionality of the Java class in a few words.\nAfter Changes: **Returns** the main functionality of the given Java class in a few words.\n\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nHere is the associated pull request(s):\nThere is no pull request associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nEND OF COMMIT CONTEXT\n\nYour commit message: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"type\": \"fix\",\n    \"subject\": \"Handle null session in getProductStoreId\",\n    \"body\": \"This commit fixes a potential NullPointerException in the getProductStoreId method by introducing a null check for the session.

However, the changes will affect the way it handles the context class loader.\n\n**Why:** The method remains responsible for handling requests and responses in a web application, but the changes will slightly modify its behavior regarding context class loaders.\n\n**How-to-use:** The method remains the same, being an overridden method of the request dispatcher interface. However, the changes will affect the way it sets the context class loader.\n\n**How-it-is-done:** The method will still handle a request by executing the request handler, handling exceptions, and updating the request and response objects. However, the changes will affect the way it sets the context class loader.\n\n**Property:** The method remains responsible for handling incoming requests and sending responses. However, the changes will affect the way it handles the context class loader, which may affect the behavior of the method in certain scenarios.\n\nSpecifically, the changes will:\n\n* Remove the setting of the context class loader for the current thread in lines 24 and 85.\n* Replace the setting of the context class loader for the current thread in lines 20 and 81 with a new class loader, MY_CLASSLOADER.\n* Replace the new PrivilegedAction in line 80 with a new one that uses MY_CLASSLOADER.\n\nThese changes will affect the way the method handles context class loaders, which may impact its behavior in certain scenarios.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe summaries of the modified classes before and after the changes are described as follows:\nClass: StandardHostValve\nBefore Changes: Handles HTTP requests and responses.\nAfter Changes: Handles HTTP requests and responses by selecting the appropriate child Context to process the request.\n\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nHere is the associated pull request(s):\nThere is no pull request associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nEND OF COMMIT CONTEXT\n\nYour commit message: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"type\": \"fix\",\n    \"subject\": \"Optimize context class loader usage in StandardHostValve\",\n    \"body\": \"This commit optimizes the usage of context class loaders in the StandardHostValve class.

However, the condition for checking nullity of obj has changed. Now, it will check if obj is not an instance of ParameterizedType, instead of checking if obj is null.\n\n**Why:** The method still compares two parameterized types for equality, considering the raw type and the actual type arguments. The reason for this comparison remains the same, to check if two instances of the class are equal.\n\n**How-to-use:** The method still checks if two instances of the class are equal. However, the condition for checking equality has changed. Now, it will return false if obj is not an instance of ParameterizedType, instead of returning false if obj is null.\n\n**How-it-is-done:** The method still checks if two parameterized types are equal. The logic for checking equality remains the same, but the condition for checking nullity of obj has changed.\n\n**Property:** The method still checks if two ParameterizedType objects are equal. The pre-condition remains the same, but the post-condition has changed. Now, it will return false if obj is not an instance of ParameterizedType, instead of returning false if obj is null.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe functionality of the modified classes remains the same before and after the changes.\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nHere is the associated pull request(s):\nThere is no pull request associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nEND OF COMMIT CONTEXT\n\nYour commit message: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"type\": \"fix\",\n    \"subject\": \"Fix equals method to handle non-ParameterizedType objects\",\n    \"body\": \"The equals method in SimpleParameterizedType now correctly handles non-ParameterizedType objects by checking if the object is an instance of ParameterizedType.
