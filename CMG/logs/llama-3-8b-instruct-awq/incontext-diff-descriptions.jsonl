To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, recovery with rescaled channel state is failing. This PR enhances `StateAssignmentOperation` to reassignment channel state and create a channel state mapping, where channels before rescaling are mapped to channels after rescaling.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Refactors `StateAssignmentOperation` in preparation. In particular, it adds a two pass approach such that vertex may assign state of other vertexes.\r\n- Adds `ChannelStateRescaler` to define rescaling behavior of in-flight data.\r\n- Adds two properties to `StreamPartitioner` to return the `ChannelStateRescaler` for upstream and downstream side.\r\n- Add upstream and downstream `ChannelStateRescaler`s to `JobEdge`, such that it is accessible to `StateAssignmentOperation`.\r\n- Adding channel reassignment to `StateAssignmentOperation`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests. The final rescale PRs will also adapt `UnalignedCheckpointITCase` to cover rescaling.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

It's really just a simple Map<ExecutionVertexID, Integer> which ties a specific vertex+subtask to an attempt count.\r\n\r\nCounts are set when an execution is registered at the EG, and retrieved when the ExecutionVertex creates a new Execution. The current attempt count is also still stored in the Execution, making the change less invasive (for example, resetForNewExecution continues to work without modifications).\r\n\r\n\r\nOne thing is that, as is, the semantics when it comes to rescaling are a bit funky.\r\nScaleUp:\r\nIf you begin with p=1 and an attempt count of 4, and then rescale to p=2, then what should the attempt count be for both subtasks?\r\nIn this version the attempt count for subtask 1 would be retained, while subtask 2 starts at 0.\r\nSetting both to 0 would also make sense, but if we downscale again to p=1 then it would be nice if the attempt count had some relation to the original count.\r\nAlternatively we could try to derive the attempt count for subtask 2 from other subtasks; in this example the obvious choice would be 2, because we're just replicating subtask 1.\r\n\r\nScaleDown:\r\nThe main issue arises when scaling down where the subtask with the largest index has the highest attempt count; currently this count would be lost. So you have p=2, and subtask 2 has an attempt count of 4, and now you scale down to p=1. The attempt count would now be solely determined by subtask 1, although we in essence just merged the two.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, I don't think resetting attempt counts to 0 is an option, because they can be used to gauge the health of a vertex, and we'd run into collisions within metrics if we ever re-use a subtask+attempt combination.\r\n\r\nThe current approach is by far the simplest, and is the only option iff we want to adhere to these rules:\r\n* every combination of subtask + attempt count is only used once\r\n* the attempt counts for a given subtask over time always form a continuous series starting at 0\r\n\r\nBut I'm quite interested in what other people think about this.\n\nEND OF COMMIT CONTEXT\n\nYour commit message: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"type\": \"fix\",\n    \"subject\": \"Update YARNFileReplicationITCase to handle job failures\",\n    \"body\": \"This commit updates the YARNFileReplicationITCase test to correctly handle job failures by throwing an AssertionError when a job fails.

It should comprehensively provide additional relevant contextual information about **all** the changes made and/or justifications/motivations behind them. It must be written as detailed as possible. If you do not provide a body, you should use an empty string for its value. You are strongly encouraged to provide a body based on all the provided context.\n- Body should not include code blocks or snippets.\n- Do not write generic/uniformative/useless sentences in body. Provide only important and relevant information.\n- The type is the software maintenance activity type of the commit that should be determined based on the commit changes, commit message body and subject. The type must be exactly one of the following: feat, fix, style, refactor.  No other values are acceptable. The definitions of these activities are given below:\nfeat: introducing NEW features into the system. (feat is short for feature)\nfix: FIXING faults or software bugs.\nstyle: code FORMAT changes such as fixing redundant white-space, adding missing semi-colons, and similar changes.\nrefactor: changes made to the INTERNAL STRUCTURE of software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behavior.\n- Type should not be repeated in the subject. Remember, type should be determined based on the commit changes, commit message body and subject.\n"}, {"role": "human", "content": "START OF COMMIT CONTEXT\n\nThe Git diff:\n\ndiff --git a/rt/transports/http/src/main/java/org/apache/cxf/transport/servlet/AbstractHTTPServlet.java b/rt/transports/http/src/main/java/org/apache/cxf/transport/servlet/AbstractHTTPServlet.java\nindex 2f4730c3b1..315ec480fb 100644\n--- a/rt/transports/http/src/main/java/org/apache/cxf/transport/servlet/AbstractHTTPServlet.java\n+++ b/rt/transports/http/src/main/java/org/apache/cxf/transport/servlet/AbstractHTTPServlet.java\n@@ -480,7 +480,7 @@ public abstract class AbstractHTTPServlet extends HttpServlet implements Filter\n                                            String originalPort) {\n             super(request);\n             this.newProtocol = originalProto;\n-            if (newRemoteAddr != null) {\n+            if (originalRemoteAddr != null) {\n                 newRemoteAddr = (originalRemoteAddr.split(\",\")[0]).trim();\n             }\n             newRequestUri = calculateNewRequestUri(request, originalPrefix);\n\n\nFile rt/transports/http/src/main/java/org/apache/cxf/transport/servlet/AbstractHTTPServlet.java has been modified in this commit. \n\nFollowing changes have been made to the file:\n\ncode lines \"if (newRemoteAddr != null) {\" have been replaced with code lines \"if (originalRemoteAddr != null) {\" in line 483\n\n\n\nChanged files relative importance:\nThere is only one changed file in this commit.
