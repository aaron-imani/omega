The new addition will exclude classes and packages that match the \"org.checkerframework.[.].*[.].*\" pattern.\n\n**Why:** The reason for this change is to further test the GCP Core API surface by checking if it correctly excludes classes and packages that match the new pattern.\n\n**How-to-use:** The usage of this test method remains the same, but now it will also test the exclusion of classes and packages that match the new pattern.\n\n**How-it-is-done:** The method will still test the GCP Core API surface by checking if it only includes the allowed classes, but now it will also check if it excludes classes and packages that match the new pattern.\n\n**Property:** The method will still test the GCP Core API surface by checking if it contains only the allowed classes, but now it will also test the exclusion of classes and packages that match the new pattern.

The usage of the method remains the same, but the scope of what it tests has expanded.\n\n**How-it-is-done:** The method will still test the direct runner API surface by checking if it only includes the specified packages and excludes others, but now it will also check for the presence of packages and classes related to checkerframework and qual. The way it does this remains the same, but the additional pruning pattern will make it more comprehensive.\n\n**Property:** The method still tests the direct runner API surface by checking if it only includes the specified packages and patterns, but now it will also test for the presence of packages and classes related to checkerframework and qual. The properties of the method remain the same, but the additional pruning pattern will make it more comprehensive.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe summaries of the modified classes before the change of the git diff are described as follows:\nDirectRunnerApiSurfaceTest: Verifies.\nGcpCoreApiSurfaceTest: Verifies.\nGcpApiSurfaceTest: Creates a GcpApiSurface object with specific allowed classes and patterns.\nThe summaries of the modified classes after the change of the git diff are described as follows:\nDirectRunnerApiSurfaceTest: Verifies.\nGcpCoreApiSurfaceTest: Verifies.\nGcpApiSurfaceTest: Creates a GcpApiSurface object with specific allowed classes.\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nHere is the associated pull request(s):\nTitle: [BEAM-10402] Enable checkerframework globally\nBody: Instead of opting out whole modules now only existing classes are opted out of type checking. This has the following benefits:\r\n\r\n - New code will be checked, even in modules that are not yet passing.\r\n - Code won't as easily backslide in modules that were partially fixed.\r\n - It will produce much more manageable incremental work, and limitless starter bugs!\r\n\r\nI produced the needed warnings (merged in other PRs) by removing the flag and then repeating the following, more or less:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./gradlew compileJava compileTestJava --continue 2>&1 | tee ~/tmp/gradle.log\r\n \r\ncat ~/tmp/gradle.log \\\r\n    | grep -e \"$PWD\"'.*error:.*' \\\r\n    | cut -d : -f 1 \\\r\n    | sort -u \\\r\n    | xargs grep -L -e '^@SuppressWarnings' \\\r\n    | xargs sed -E -i '' 's/^(public +)?((abstract|final) +)?(class|interface)/@SuppressWarnings(\"nullness\") &/'\r\n  \r\n./gradlew spotlessApply\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to still suppress type checking, arguments to `applyJavaNature`:\r\n\r\n1. `generatedClassPatterns` to exclude various generated code that is not annotated with nullness types\r\n2. `classesTriggerCheckerBugs` a map from classes which cannot be analyzed to their checkerframework bug URL\n\nEND OF COMMIT CONTEXT\n\nYour commit message: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"type\": \"feat\",\n    \"subject\": \"Enable checkerframework globally in DirectRunner, GcpCore, and GcpApiSurface tests\",\n    \"body\": \"This commit enables checkerframework globally in DirectRunner, GcpCore, and GcpApiSurface tests by adding the necessary pruning patterns to the tests.

However, the method will now have a more atomic operation of closing the files, which might be beneficial in certain scenarios.\n\n**How-it-is-done:** The method will now check if the files are already closed using the `isClosed.compareAndSet(false, true)` method. If the files are not closed, it will attempt to close them. This adds an extra layer of safety to ensure that the files are not closed multiple times.\n\n**Property:** The pre-condition of the method remains the same: the files must be open before attempting to close them. The post-condition remains the same as well: the files will be closed after the method is called. However, the method will now have a more specific property: it will only close the files if they are not already closed.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe summaries of the modified classes before the change of the git diff are described as follows:\nBigTableScanner: Creates.\nThe summaries of the modified classes after the change of the git diff are described as follows:\nBigTableScanner: Creates.\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nHere are the Jira issues linked to this commit:\nIssue ID: CASSANDRA-9531\nTitle: NullPointerException logged when running MessagePayloadTest\nBody: When I run the MessagePayloadTest I have the following error in my log output:\n\njuin 02, 2015 3:27:31 PM com.google.common.cache.LocalCache processPendingNotifications\nAVERTISSEMENT: Exception thrown by removal listener\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat org.apache.cassandra.io.compress.CompressedRandomAccessReader.getTotalBufferSize(CompressedRandomAccessReader.java:260)\n\tat org.apache.cassandra.service.FileCacheService$2.onRemoval(FileCacheService.java:105)\n\tat com.google.common.cache.LocalCache.processPendingNotifications(LocalCache.java:1954)\n\tat com.google.common.cache.LocalCache$Segment.runUnlockedCleanup(LocalCache.java:3457)\n\tat com.google.common.cache.LocalCache$Segment.postWriteCleanup(LocalCache.java:3433)\n\tat com.google.common.cache.LocalCache$Segment.remove(LocalCache.java:3104)\n\tat com.google.common.cache.LocalCache.remove(LocalCache.java:4170)\n\tat com.google.common.cache.LocalCache$LocalManualCache.invalidate(LocalCache.java:4762)\n\tat org.apache.cassandra.service.FileCacheService.invalidate(FileCacheService.java:182)\n\tat org.apache.cassandra.io.util.PoolingSegmentedFile$Cleanup.tidy(PoolingSegmentedFile.java:53)\n\tat org.apache.cassandra.io.util.CompressedPoolingSegmentedFile$Cleanup.tidy(CompressedPoolingSegmentedFile.java:77)\n\tat org.apache.cassandra.utils.concurrent.Ref$GlobalState.release(Ref.java:285)\n\tat org.apache.cassandra.utils.concurrent.Ref$State.ensureReleased(Ref.java:164)\n\tat org.apache.cassandra.utils.concurrent.Ref.ensureReleased(Ref.java:89)\n\tat org.apache.cassandra.utils.concurrent.SharedCloseableImpl.close(SharedCloseableImpl.java:45)\n\tat org.apache.cassandra.io.sstable.format.SSTableReader$InstanceTidier$1.run(SSTableReader.java:1937)\n\tat java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:471)\n\tat java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:262)\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor$ScheduledFutureTask.access$201(ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.java:178)\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor$ScheduledFutureTask.run(ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.java:292)\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1145)\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:615)\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\n\n\nThe problem is due to the fact that when getTotalBufferSize is called the segment has already been desallocated.

The added attributes do not change the method's purpose.\n\n**How-to-use:** The method's usage remains the same. It is still used to retrieve the set of attribute names that are indexed in the database.\n\n**How-it-is-done:** The method's implementation remains the same, with the added attributes not affecting the logic of the method.\n\n**Property:** The method's properties remain the same, including the pre-condition (the iterator is not null) and post-condition (the set of attribute names is returned). The added attributes do not affect the method's properties.\n\nThe added attributes will be executed after lines 4, 8, and 14, respectively.

After line 4: The added attribute will likely be some kind of logging or debugging statement, which will be executed before the actual iteration of the iterator.\n2.

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number.

This PR enhances `StateAssignmentOperation` to reassignment channel state and create a channel state mapping, where channels before rescaling are mapped to channels after rescaling.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Refactors `StateAssignmentOperation` in preparation. In particular, it adds a two pass approach such that vertex may assign state of other vertexes.\r\n- Adds `ChannelStateRescaler` to define rescaling behavior of in-flight data.\r\n- Adds two properties to `StreamPartitioner` to return the `ChannelStateRescaler` for upstream and downstream side.\r\n- Add upstream and downstream `ChannelStateRescaler`s to `JobEdge`, such that it is accessible to `StateAssignmentOperation`.\r\n- Adding channel reassignment to `StateAssignmentOperation`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests. The final rescale PRs will also adapt `UnalignedCheckpointITCase` to cover rescaling.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

It's really just a simple Map<ExecutionVertexID, Integer> which ties a specific vertex+subtask to an attempt count.\r\n\r\nCounts are set when an execution is registered at the EG, and retrieved when the ExecutionVertex creates a new Execution. The current attempt count is also still stored in the Execution, making the change less invasive (for example, resetForNewExecution continues to work without modifications).\r\n\r\n\r\nOne thing is that, as is, the semantics when it comes to rescaling are a bit funky.\r\nScaleUp:\r\nIf you begin with p=1 and an attempt count of 4, and then rescale to p=2, then what should the attempt count be for both subtasks?\r\nIn this version the attempt count for subtask 1 would be retained, while subtask 2 starts at 0.\r\nSetting both to 0 would also make sense, but if we downscale again to p=1 then it would be nice if the attempt count had some relation to the original count.\r\nAlternatively we could try to derive the attempt count for subtask 2 from other subtasks; in this example the obvious choice would be 2, because we're just replicating subtask 1.\r\n\r\nScaleDown:\r\nThe main issue arises when scaling down where the subtask with the largest index has the highest attempt count; currently this count would be lost. So you have p=2, and subtask 2 has an attempt count of 4, and now you scale down to p=1. The attempt count would now be solely determined by subtask 1, although we in essence just merged the two.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, I don't think resetting attempt counts to 0 is an option, because they can be used to gauge the health of a vertex, and we'd run into collisions within metrics if we ever re-use a subtask+attempt combination.\r\n\r\nThe current approach is by far the simplest, and is the only option iff we want to adhere to these rules:\r\n* every combination of subtask + attempt count is only used once\r\n* the attempt counts for a given subtask over time always form a continuous series starting at 0\r\n\r\nBut I'm quite interested in what other people think about this.\n\nEND OF COMMIT CONTEXT\n\nYour commit message: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"type\": \"fix\",\n    \"subject\": \"Handle job failures in YARNFileReplicationITCase\",\n    \"body\": \"This commit fixes a bug in YARNFileReplicationITCase by adding error handling code to the deployPerJob method.

There was no need to use this tool.\n\nThis is the changed method(s) summaries:\nHere are the summaries for all changed methods in this git diff in the commit url. For each method's before and after change versions, the summaries summarize it from five different perspectives: \n\nWhat: Describes the functionality of a method\nWhy: Explains the reason why a method is provided or the design rationale of the method\nHow-to-use: Describes the usage or the expected set-up of using a method\nHow-it-is-done: Describes the implementation details of a method\nProperty: Asserts properties of a method including pre-conditions or post-conditions of a method\n\nMethod public void addLeader(int leaderPattern, int leaderLengthMinimum, int leaderLengthOptimum, int leaderLengthMaximum, int ruleStyle, int ruleThickness, int leaderPatternWidth, int leaderAlignment) is modified by this git diff.\nThe method summaries before the commit are:\nWhat: adds a leader to the current area with specified properties .\nWhy: adds a leader to the current line of text .\nHow-to-use: this method is used to add a leader to a document .\nHow-it-is-done: adds a leader to the document , which is a visual element used to separate sections or to indicate a change in the document's content .\nProperty: adds a leader to the document, which is a visual element used to separate sections of text .\n\n\nBased on the provided changes, here's how each aspect of the method will change:\n\n**What:** The method will still add a leader to the current area with specified properties. However, the changes will affect the calculation of the leader's length and the addition of the leader to the document.\n\n**Why:** The method will still add a leader to the current line of text. The changes will not affect the purpose or design rationale of the method.\n\n**How-to-use:** The method will still be used to add a leader to a document. The changes will not affect the usage or expected set-up of the method.\n\n**How-it-is-done:** The method will still add a leader to the document, which is a visual element used to separate sections or to indicate a change in the document's content. The changes will affect the calculation of the leader's length and the addition of the leader to the document.\n\n**Property:** The method will still add a leader to the document, which is a visual element used to separate sections of text. The changes will not affect the pre-conditions or post-conditions of the method.\n\nSpecific changes:\n\n* The addition of the new `if` statement will provide an additional condition for calculating the leader's length. If the `leaderLengthOptimum` is greater than `leaderLengthMaximum` and less than `remainingWidth`, the leader's length will be set to `leaderLengthOptimum`.\n* The replacement of `int leaderLength;` with `int leaderLength = 0;` will initialize the `leaderLength` variable to 0, which will affect the calculation of the leader's length.\n* The replacement of the `if` statement in line 10 with `if ((remainingWidth <= leaderLengthOptimum) || (remainingWidth <= leaderLengthMaximum)) {` will change the condition for calculating the leader's length.\n* The replacement of the `if` statement in line 11 with `} else if ((remainingWidth > leaderLengthOptimum) && (remainingWidth > leaderLengthMaximum)) {` will change the condition for calculating the leader's length.\n* The replacement of `} else {` with `leaderLength = leaderLengthMaximum;` will set the leader's length to `leaderLengthMaximum` when the condition in line 11 is true.\n\nOverall, the changes will affect the calculation of the leader's length and the addition of the leader to the document, but the method's purpose and usage will remain the same.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe summaries of the modified classes before the change of the git diff are described as follows:\nLineArea: Handles.\nThe summaries of the modified classes after the change of the git diff are described as follows:\nLineArea: Handles.\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nHere is the associated pull request(s):\nThere is no pull request associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nEND OF COMMIT CONTEXT\n\nYour commit message: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"type\": \"refactor\",\n    \"subject\": \"Refactor leader length calculation in LineArea.java\",\n    \"body\": \"This commit refactors the leader length calculation in LineArea.java.

FileOps.exists(dir) )\n        throw new CmdException(\"Directory not found: \"+dir) ;\n}\n```\nThe new version of the code block is:\n```\nif (Lib.equal(dir, Names.memName)) {\n    log.info(\"TDB dataset: in-memory\") ;\n} else {\n    if ( ! FileOps.exists(dir) )\n        throw new CmdException(\"Directory not found: \"+dir) ;\n    log.info(\"TDB dataset: directory=\"+dir) ;\n}\n```\nThe main difference is the addition of a new condition to check if the directory is equal to the memory name, and the addition of an else block to handle the case where the directory is not equal to the memory name.\n\nChanged files relative importance:\nThere is only one changed file in this commit.

Instead, it will test for resources with labels containing the phrase \"feeling a déjà vu\", \"not déjà vu\", and \"Déja Vü\". The method will also test the analyzer's ability to match accents.\n\n**Why:** The reason for the test remains the same: to test the configurable analyzer for case and accent insensitivity. However, the test now covers more scenarios, including the presence of the phrase \"not déjà vu\" and the analyzer's ability to match accents.\n\n**How-to-use:** The usage of the method remains the same: it's a test case for the configurable analyzer to check if it is case and accent insensitive. However, the test now covers more scenarios, so the user of the method needs to be aware of these additional cases.\n\n**How-it-is-done:** The method will now test the configurable analyzer by searching for resources with labels containing the phrases \"feeling a déjà vu\", \"not déjà vu\", and \"Déja Vü\". The method will also test the analyzer's ability to match accents. The test will be more comprehensive, covering more scenarios.\n\n**Property:** The method still tests the configurable analyzer for case and accent insensitivity, but now it covers more scenarios, including the presence of the phrase \"not déjà vu\" and the analyzer's ability to match accents.

Additionally, the method will write the detailed information about each thread, but it will not include the stack trace of each thread.\n\n**Why:** The method is still provided to write the thread dump to the output stream, but the design rationale might be slightly changed since it will now include the total number of threads instead of the number of daemon threads.\n\n**How-to-use:** The method can still be used to write the thread dump to the output stream, but the user needs to be aware that the method will now include the total number of threads instead of the number of daemon threads.\n\n**How-it-is-done:** The method will still write the thread dump to the output stream, but it will now include the total number of threads instead of the number of daemon threads. The method will iterate over the thread IDs and get the corresponding ThreadInfo objects, and then write the detailed information about each thread to the output stream.\n\n**Property:** The method will still write the thread dump to the given output stream, but it will now include the total number of threads instead of the number of daemon threads.

If the session is null, it will return null immediately, instead of trying to get the product store id and potentially throwing a NullPointerException.\n\n**Property:** The method's property remains the same, but with the added consideration that it will return null if the session is null.

However, the method will now also handle the case where the byte array is empty, so the property of writing the specified portion of the byte array to the output stream in a human-readable format still applies.\n\nNote that the changes will add some new behavior to the method, such as writing \"No Data\" to the output stream when the byte array is empty.

However, the changes will affect the way it sets the context class loader.\n\n**Property:** The method remains responsible for handling incoming requests and sending responses. However, the changes will affect the way it handles the context class loader, which may affect the behavior of the method in certain scenarios.\n\nSpecifically, the changes will:\n\n* Remove the setting of the context class loader for the current thread in lines 24 and 85.\n* Replace the setting of the context class loader for the current thread in lines 20 and 81 with a new class loader, MY_CLASSLOADER.\n* Replace the new PrivilegedAction in line 80 with a new one that uses MY_CLASSLOADER.\n\nThese changes will affect the way the method handles context class loaders, which may impact its behavior in certain scenarios.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe summaries of the modified classes before the change of the git diff are described as follows:\nStandardHostValve: Handles requests and responses for a web application.\nThe summaries of the modified classes after the change of the git diff are described as follows:\nStandardHostValve: Handles requests and responses for a web application.\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nHere is the associated pull request(s):\nThere is no pull request associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nEND OF COMMIT CONTEXT\n\nYour commit message: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"type\": \"fix\",\n    \"subject\": \"Reduce getClassLoader() calls in StandardHostValve\",\n    \"body\": \"This commit reduces the number of calls to getClassLoader() in StandardHostValve by introducing a static final variable MY_CLASSLOADER and replacing hardcoded getClassLoader() calls with MY_CLASSLOADER.

The method will also set the webBeansContext to noContext in the appContext.\n\n**Why:** The method is still used to initialize and configure the application's beans and services, but the addition of setting the webBeansContext to noContext might indicate that the method is now used to disable the web beans context.\n\n**How-to-use:** The method is still used to initialize and configure the application's beans and services, but the addition of setting the webBeansContext to noContext might indicate that the method is now used to disable the web beans context. The method will still be used to initialize the thread singleton service, but it will no longer check if there are beans in the appInfo.\n\n**How-it-is-done:** The method will still build the application by initializing the thread singleton service and setting up the startup object with the app context, app info, and all deployments.

However, the location and password will be replaced with empty strings, which may lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n**Why:** The reason why this method is provided remains the same: to load the default trust store and return the trust managers. However, the changes may affect the trust store's integrity and security.\n\n**How-to-use:** The method will still return the default trust managers for a given truststore location and password. However, the empty strings may cause issues when trying to use the method.\n\n**How-it-is-done:** The method will still load the default trust store and return the trust managers. However, the changes may affect the trust store's loading and initialization.\n\n**Property:** The method will still return an array of trust managers initialized from a default trust store. However, the changes may affect the trust store's integrity and security, which may impact the method's property.\n\nIn summary, the changes will likely affect the method's behavior, making it less reliable and secure. The method may return unexpected results or throw exceptions due to the empty strings replacing the location and password.\n\nMethod public static String getSecureSocketProtocol(String secureSocketProtocol, Logger log) is deleted by this git diff.\nIts summaries are: \nWhat: gets the secure socket protocol .\nWhy: gets the secure socket protocol to use for communication, either from a provided value or a default value if none is provided .\nHow-to-use: used to get the secure socket protocol to use for SSL/TLS connections .\nHow-it-is-done: a method that sets the secure socket protocol and logs a message if it's set or not set .\nProperty: returns the secure socket protocol to use for the connection , either the one provided or the default one if none is provided .\n\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe summaries of the modified classes before the change of the git diff are described as follows:\nSSLUtils: Creates.\nThe summaries of the modified classes after the change of the git diff are described as follows:\nSSLUtils: Creates.\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nHere is the associated pull request(s):\nThere is no pull request associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nEND OF COMMIT CONTEXT\n\nYour commit message: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"type\": \"refactor\",\n    \"subject\": \"Refactor SSLUtils.java to remove unused code and improve code style\",\n    \"body\": \"This commit refactors the SSLUtils.java file by removing unused code and improving code style.
