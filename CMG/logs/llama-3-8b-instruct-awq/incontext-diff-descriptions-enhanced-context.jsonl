Instead of directly closing the files, it will check if the files are already closed before attempting to close them.\n\n**Why:** The reason for providing this method remains the same: to ensure that the input and output files are properly closed after use.\n\n**How-to-use:** The usage of the method remains the same: it's still used to close the input and output files after use. However, the method will now have a more atomic operation of closing the files, which might be beneficial in certain scenarios.\n\n**How-it-is-done:** The method will now check if the files are already closed using the `isClosed.compareAndSet(false, true)` method. If the files are not closed, it will attempt to close them. This adds an extra layer of safety to ensure that the files are not closed multiple times.\n\n**Property:** The pre-condition of the method remains the same: the files must be open before attempting to close them.

method\nProperty: Asserts properties of a method including pre-conditions or post-conditions of a method\n\nMethod public Event.SchemaChange announceMigration(QueryState queryState, boolean isLocalOnly) throws RequestValidationException is modified by this git diff.\nThe method summaries before the commit are:\nWhat: announces a schema change for a materialized view .\nWhy: announces a schema change event for a materialized view .\nHow-to-use: called when a materialized view is updated .\nHow-it-is-done: announces a schema change for a materialized view by updating its parameters and notifying the migration manager .\nProperty: announces a schema change event for a materialized view in a cassandra database .\n\n\nHere's how each aspect of the method will change after the changes are applied:\n\n**What:** The method will still announce a schema change for a materialized view, but with some additional constraints on the default_time_to_live parameter.\n\n**Why:** The method is still used to announce a schema change event for a materialized view, but with a stronger emphasis on the constraints on the default_time_to_live parameter.\n\n**How-to-use:** The method is still called when a materialized view is updated, but with the added requirement that default_time_to_live must be set to zero.\n\n**How-it-is-done:** The method will still update the parameters of the materialized view and notify the migration manager, but with the additional check for default_time_to_live.\n\n**Property:** The method will still announce a schema change event for a materialized view in a Cassandra database, but with the added property that default_time_to_live must be set to zero.\n\nSpecifically, the changes will:\n\n* Add a new constraint on default_time_to_live, which must be set to zero.\n* Replace the error message in line 24 with a more specific error message indicating that default_time_to_live is forbidden.\n* Add a new error message in line 26, which explains the reason why default_time_to_live must be set to zero.Method public void testAlterMvWithTTL() throws Throwable is modified by this git diff.\nThe method summaries before the commit are:\nWhat: tests the functionality of altering a materialized view with a time to live (TTL) constraint .\nWhy: test case for altering a materialized view with a time to live (ttl) constraint .\nHow-to-use: test case for altering a materialized view with a time to live (TTL) .\nHow-it-is-done: test that altering a materialized view with a time to live (ttl) fails .\nProperty: tests that altering a materialized view does not allow specifying default_time_to_live .\n\n\nHere's how each aspect of the method will change after the changes are applied:\n\n**What:** The method will still test the functionality of altering a materialized view with a time to live (TTL) constraint, but it will also test the usage of the \"USE\" command before altering the materialized view.\n\n**Why:** The reason why this method is provided remains the same, which is to test the functionality of altering a materialized view with a TTL constraint.\n\n**How-to-use:** The method will now also test the usage of the \"USE\" command before altering the materialized view, in addition to testing the alteration of the materialized view with a TTL constraint.\n\n**How-it-is-done:** The method will still test that altering a materialized view with a TTL constraint fails, but it will also test the usage of the \"USE\" command before altering the materialized view.\n\n**Property:** The method will still test that altering a materialized view does not allow specifying default_time_to_live, but it will also test the pre-condition of using the \"USE\" command before altering the materialized view.\n\nIn summary, the changes will add more functionality to the test case, including testing the usage of the \"USE\" command before altering the materialized view.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, recovery with rescaled channel state is failing. This PR enhances `StateAssignmentOperation` to reassignment channel state and create a channel state mapping, where channels before rescaling are mapped to channels after rescaling.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Refactors `StateAssignmentOperation` in preparation. In particular, it adds a two pass approach such that vertex may assign state of other vertexes.\r\n- Adds `ChannelStateRescaler` to define rescaling behavior of in-flight data.\r\n- Adds two properties to `StreamPartitioner` to return the `ChannelStateRescaler` for upstream and downstream side.\r\n- Add upstream and downstream `ChannelStateRescaler`s to `JobEdge`, such that it is accessible to `StateAssignmentOperation`.\r\n- Adding channel reassignment to `StateAssignmentOperation`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests. The final rescale PRs will also adapt `UnalignedCheckpointITCase` to cover rescaling.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

It's really just a simple Map<ExecutionVertexID, Integer> which ties a specific vertex+subtask to an attempt count.\r\n\r\nCounts are set when an execution is registered at the EG, and retrieved when the ExecutionVertex creates a new Execution. The current attempt count is also still stored in the Execution, making the change less invasive (for example, resetForNewExecution continues to work without modifications).\r\n\r\n\r\nOne thing is that, as is, the semantics when it comes to rescaling are a bit funky.\r\nScaleUp:\r\nIf you begin with p=1 and an attempt count of 4, and then rescale to p=2, then what should the attempt count be for both subtasks?\r\nIn this version the attempt count for subtask 1 would be retained, while subtask 2 starts at 0.\r\nSetting both to 0 would also make sense, but if we downscale again to p=1 then it would be nice if the attempt count had some relation to the original count.\r\nAlternatively we could try to derive the attempt count for subtask 2 from other subtasks; in this example the obvious choice would be 2, because we're just replicating subtask 1.\r\n\r\nScaleDown:\r\nThe main issue arises when scaling down where the subtask with the largest index has the highest attempt count; currently this count would be lost. So you have p=2, and subtask 2 has an attempt count of 4, and now you scale down to p=1. The attempt count would now be solely determined by subtask 1, although we in essence just merged the two.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, I don't think resetting attempt counts to 0 is an option, because they can be used to gauge the health of a vertex, and we'd run into collisions within metrics if we ever re-use a subtask+attempt combination.\r\n\r\nThe current approach is by far the simplest, and is the only option iff we want to adhere to these rules:\r\n* every combination of subtask + attempt count is only used once\r\n* the attempt counts for a given subtask over time always form a continuous series starting at 0\r\n\r\nBut I'm quite interested in what other people think about this.\n\nEND OF COMMIT CONTEXT\n\nYour commit message: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"type\": \"fix\",\n    \"subject\": \"Handle job failures in YARNFileReplicationITCase\",\n    \"body\": \"This commit fixes the issue where job failures were not handled properly in YARNFileReplicationITCase.

However, the method will no longer consider the language when creating a new engine.\n\n**Why:** The method will still retrieve or create an instance of the engine, but the reason for creating a new engine will be different. Previously, a new engine was created for a specific language, but now a new engine will be created without considering the language.\n\n**How-to-use:** The method will still be used to get an instance of Invocable from a pool of engines. However, the method will no longer require a language as a parameter, so the usage will be simpler.\n\n**How-it-is-done:** The method will still get an invocable engine from a pool, but now it will create a new engine without considering the language. This might affect the behavior of the method if the language is important for the engine's functionality.\n\n**Property:** The method will still return an invocable engine instance from a pool or creates a new one if not available. However, the method will no longer guarantee that the engine is specific to a language, so the post-condition of the method will be different.Method private Invocable createEngine() is newly added by this git diff.\nIts summaries are: \nWhat: creates and configures a scripting engine for a given language, loads the script library and functions, and initializes the engine with the necessary functions .\nWhy: creates an invocable script engine instance for the specified scripting language, loads the script library and functions, and initializes the engine .\nHow-to-use: This method is used to create an Invocable object from a ScriptEngine object, which is used to execute scripts in a Java application.\nHow-it-is-done: creates an invocable script engine instance for the specified scripting language , loads the script library and functions , and initializes the engine with the necessary functions .\nProperty: creates and initializes a script engine for the given scripting language, loads the script library and functions, and returns the invocable engine .\n\n\nMethod private static Invocable createEngine(String lang) is deleted by this git diff.\nIts summaries are: \nWhat: creates an invocable script engine instance for a given scripting language .\nWhy: creates an invocable script engine instance for the specified language and loads the necessary scripts and functions .\nHow-to-use: This method is used to create an Invocable object for a given scripting language.

However, the way it does it will change slightly.\n\n**Why:** The method is still loading a class from a URL, but the implementation will change.\n\n**How-to-use:** The method is still called to load a class from a resource, but the internal implementation will change.\n\n**How-it-is-done:** The method will still load a class from a URL, but it will do so by reading the entire class file into a byte array, instead of using a lazy approach.\n\n**Property:** The method will still load a class from a resource and define it, but the property of loading the entire class file into memory will be added.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the changes:\n\n* Line 15 removal: The lazy approach of using sun.misc is removed, which means the method will no longer use a buffer to read the class file. Instead, it will read the entire file into memory.\n* Replacement of \"byte[] bytecode;\" with \"byte[] bytecode = new byte[len];\": This change creates a new byte array of the correct size to hold the class file. This is necessary because the method will no longer use a buffer to read the file.\n* Replacement of \"// laziness means using sun.misc\" with \"IOUtils.readFully(in, bytecode);\": This change replaces the lazy approach with a call to IOUtils.readFully, which reads the entire file into the byte array.\n\nOverall, the changes will make the method more straightforward and less efficient, as it will read the entire class file into memory instead of using a buffer.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe summaries of the modified classes before and after the changes are described as follows:\nClass: TestClassLoader\nBefore Changes: Loads classes from the classpath, prioritizing classes within its own package.\nAfter Changes: Loads classes from the classpath and overrides the default class loader.\n\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nHere is the associated pull request(s):\nThere is no pull request associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nEND OF COMMIT CONTEXT\n\nYour commit message: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"type\": \"refactor\",\n    \"subject\": \"Refactor TestClassLoader to read entire class file into memory\",\n    \"body\": \"This commit refactors the TestClassLoader to read the entire class file into memory instead of using a lazy approach.

However, the method will now also handle the case where the byte array is empty, so the property of writing the specified portion of the byte array to the output stream in a human-readable format still applies.\n\nNote that the changes will add some new behavior to the method, such as writing \"No Data\" to the output stream when the byte array is empty.

However, it will now catch and handle Throwable exceptions instead of just Exception exceptions.\n\nWhy: The method will still list the beans that match the given query and print their attributes. However, it will now be more robust in handling exceptions, which could potentially lead to a better understanding of the method's purpose.\n\nHow-to-use: The method will still be used to list beans that match a given query. It will still print the name of each bean and its attributes to the writer. However, it will now be more robust in handling exceptions, which could potentially lead to a better understanding of the method's usage.\n\nHow-it-is-done: The method will still list beans and their attributes in a specified query. However, it will now catch and handle Throwable exceptions, which could potentially lead to a better understanding of how the method handles exceptions.\n\nProperty: The method will still print the list of beans that match the query, along with their attributes and values. However, it will now have a more robust exception handling mechanism, which could potentially lead to a better understanding of the method's properties.\n\nIn summary, the changes will make the method more robust in handling exceptions, but the method's purpose, usage, and properties will remain the same.Method public boolean isSupported(String type) is newly added by this git diff.\nIts summaries are: \nWhat: this method always returns true, indicating that all types are supported .\nWhy: checks if the given type is supported by the class .\nHow-to-use: This method always returns true, indicating that the specified type is supported.\nHow-it-is-done: always returns true, indicating that the type is supported .\nProperty: returns true , indicating that this node supports the specified type .\n\n\nMethod public boolean isSupported(String type) is deleted by this git diff.\nIts summaries are: \nWhat: This method always returns true, indicating that all types are supported.\nWhy: checks if the given type is supported .\nHow-to-use: this method always returns true, indicating that the given type is supported .\nHow-it-is-done: always returns true, indicating that the type is supported .\nProperty: returns true , indicating that this node supports the specified type of event .\n\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe functionality of the modified classes remains the same before and after the changes.\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nHere is the associated pull request(s):\nThere is no pull request associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nEND OF COMMIT CONTEXT\n\nYour commit message: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"type\": \"fix\",\n    \"subject\": \"Handle Throwable exceptions in JMXProxyServlet\",\n    \"body\": \"This commit fixes the JMXProxyServlet by catching and handling Throwable exceptions in the listBeans method.
