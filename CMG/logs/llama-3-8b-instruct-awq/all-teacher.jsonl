The changes include the addition of a new method `getProxyConfiguration()` and the deletion of the `getTestConfiguration()` method. The `setUp()` method has also been modified to use the new `getProxyConfiguration()` method. The changes affect two test classes, `DefaultProxyManagerTest` and `LegacyProxyManagerTest`, which test the functionality of a proxy manager by downloading and verifying artifacts.\n\nThe changes are highlighted in the Git diff, which shows the addition and removal of code lines. The `getProxyConfiguration()` method is added to both test classes, while the `getTestConfiguration()` method is removed. The `setUp()` method is modified to use the new `getProxyConfiguration()` method.\n\n# Why\n\nThe changes are made to improve the test configuration for the Maven repository proxy. The `getProxyConfiguration()` method is added to provide a way to set up the proxy configuration for the test environment. This allows for more flexibility and customization of the test configuration.\n\nThe `getTestConfiguration()` method is removed because it is no longer needed. The new `getProxyConfiguration()` method provides a more comprehensive way to set up the test configuration.\n\n# Commit Message\n\n{\n\"type\": \"feat\",\n\"subject\": \"Introduce getProxyConfiguration() method and refactor test setup\",\n\"body\": \"This commit introduces a new method getProxyConfiguration() to set up the proxy configuration for the test environment.

The method is added to the `ColumnFamilyStore` class as well, but it is not changed. The `ColumnFamilyStoreMBean` class also has a removed method `getWriteLatency()`.\n\nThe changes are made to provide additional information about the performance and operations of the Column Family Store. The `getPendingTasks()` method is added to allow users to retrieve the number of tasks that are currently pending execution, which can be useful for monitoring and debugging purposes.\n\n# Why\n\nThe motivation behind this change is to provide additional information about the performance and operations of the Column Family Store. The `getPendingTasks()` method is added to allow users to retrieve the number of tasks that are currently pending execution, which can be useful for monitoring and debugging purposes.\n\nThe change is also related to the Jira issue CASSANDRA-173, which requests the addition of an atomic integer to track the number of pending tasks.

The `UNCHANGED` lines are the unchanged parts of the class.\n\nThe `getSourceProperty` method is also modified. The method is used to retrieve a source property from a WebDAV resource. The changes involve updating the implementation details of the method to use the `propfind` method to retrieve the property and then parsing the XML response to extract the property.\n\n# Why\n\nThe changes are made to update the version information in the `WebDAVSource` class. The old version information is removed, and the new version information is added. This is likely done to reflect changes in the WebDAV protocol or to update the version number.\n\nThe changes to the `getSourceProperty` method are made to improve the implementation of the method. The new implementation uses the `propfind` method to retrieve the property and then parses the XML response to extract the property.

The new test case provides additional assurance that the DOMBuilder is correctly handling multiple characters events, which is an important aspect of its functionality.\n\nThe removal of the old test case was necessary to simplify the test suite and reduce the risk of test duplication.

In `MemoryChangeLogStoreTest`, the `testLogCheckRevision` method was added, which tests the log functionality of a store by adding a new entry and checking the current revision. In `ConfidentialityRequiredITest`, the `configureLdapServer` method was modified to set the confidentiality required flag to true for the LDAP server. Additionally, the `testConfidentiality` method was modified to test the confidentiality of a LDAP connection by performing various operations such as binding, searching, adding, modifying, renaming, and deleting.\n\nThe changes in `MemoryChangeLogStoreTest` include the addition of a new method `testLogCheckRevision` and the modification of an existing method `testLogCheckRevision` to throw `NamingException` instead of `Exception`. The changes in `ConfidentialityRequiredITest` include the modification of the `configureLdapServer` method to set the confidentiality required flag to true and the addition of comments to the `testConfidentiality` method.\n\n# Why\n\nThe changes in this commit are likely intended to improve the testing of the Apache Directory Server's confidentiality feature. The addition of the `testLogCheckRevision` method in `MemoryChangeLogStoreTest` suggests that the developers are trying to test the log functionality of the store in more detail. The modification of the `configureLdapServer` method in `ConfidentialityRequiredITest` suggests that the developers are trying to set up the LDAP server to require confidentiality for connections.\n\n# Commit Message\n\n{\n\"type\": \"feat\",\n\"subject\": \"Improve testing of Apache Directory Server's confidentiality feature\",\n\"body\": \"This commit improves the testing of the Apache Directory Server's confidentiality feature by adding a new method to test the log functionality of the store and modifying the configureLdapServer method to set the confidentiality required flag to true.

`LdapCoreSessionConnection` class to handle LDAP operations. Specifically, the changes include:\n\n* Adding the `connect()` method, which always returns `true` and indicates a successful connection.\n* Adding the `bind()` method, which throws an exception because the bind operation is not supported on CoreSession-based connections.\n* Adding the `anonymousBind()` method, which performs an anonymous bind operation to the LDAP directory.\n* Adding the `bind(BindRequest bindRequest)` method, which binds a client to the LDAP server using the provided bind request.\n* Removing the `anonymousBind()`, `bind()`, and `bind(BindRequest bindRequest)` methods, which were previously implemented but are no longer supported.\n\nThese changes aim to improve the functionality and usability of the `LdapCoreSessionConnection` class, making it more robust and efficient for handling LDAP operations.\n\n# Why\n\nThe motivations behind these changes are to:\n\n* Simplify the `LdapCoreSessionConnection` class by removing unsupported methods and improving the overall structure.\n* Enhance the functionality of the class by adding new methods that provide more flexibility and control over LDAP operations.\n* Improve the error handling and exception throwing mechanisms to provide more informative and actionable error messages.\n\nBy making these changes, the commit aims to improve the maintainability, scalability, and reliability of the `LdapCoreSessionConnection` class, ultimately benefiting the overall performance and usability of the LDAP directory.\n\n# Commit Message\n\n{\n\"type\": \"feat\",\n\"subject\": \"Improved LdapCoreSessionConnection class with new methods and simplified structure\",\n\"body\": \"This commit simplifies the LdapCoreSessionConnection class by removing unsupported methods and improving the overall structure.

This change ensures that the superclass's `shutdown` method is called, which is important for proper shutdown of the Kafka cluster.\n\nThe commit does not introduce any new features, but rather refactors the existing code to improve its functionality and maintainability.\n\n# Why\n\nThe motivation behind this change is to improve the robustness and reliability of the Kafka cluster shutdown process. By stopping all brokers and the Zookeeper, and then cleaning up temporary directories, the commit ensures that the shutdown process is thorough and complete. Additionally, the addition of the `throws Exception` clause allows for more flexible error handling, which can help to improve the overall reliability of the system.\n\nThe commit also improves the maintainability of the code by following best practices for shutdown methods, such as calling the superclass's `shutdown` method. This change makes the code more consistent and easier to understand, which can help to reduce the risk of errors and improve the overall quality of the system.\n\n# Commit Message\n\n{\n\"type\": \"fix\",\n\"subject\": \"Improve Kafka cluster shutdown process\",\n\"body\": \"This commit refactors the `shutdown` method in `KafkaTestEnvironmentImpl` to improve the robustness and reliability of the Kafka cluster shutdown process.

It's really just a simple Map<ExecutionVertexID, Integer> which ties a specific vertex+subtask to an attempt count.\r\n\r\nCounts are set when an execution is registered at the EG, and retrieved when the ExecutionVertex creates a new Execution. The current attempt count is also still stored in the Execution, making the change less invasive (for example, resetForNewExecution continues to work without modifications).\r\n\r\n\r\nOne thing is that, as is, the semantics when it comes to rescaling are a bit funky.\r\nScaleUp:\r\nIf you begin with p=1 and an attempt count of 4, and then rescale to p=2, then what should the attempt count be for both subtasks?\r\nIn this version the attempt count for subtask 1 would be retained, while subtask 2 starts at 0.\r\nSetting both to 0 would also make sense, but if we downscale again to p=1 then it would be nice if the attempt count had some relation to the original count.\r\nAlternatively we could try to derive the attempt count for subtask 2 from other subtasks; in this example the obvious choice would be 2, because we're just replicating subtask 1.\r\n\r\nScaleDown:\r\nThe main issue arises when scaling down where the subtask with the largest index has the highest attempt count; currently this count would be lost. So you have p=2, and subtask 2 has an attempt count of 4, and now you scale down to p=1. The attempt count would now be solely determined by subtask 1, although we in essence just merged the two.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, I don't think resetting attempt counts to 0 is an option, because they can be used to gauge the health of a vertex, and we'd run into collisions within metrics if we ever re-use a subtask+attempt combination.\r\n\r\nThe current approach is by far the simplest, and is the only option iff we want to adhere to these rules:\r\n* every combination of subtask + attempt count is only used once\r\n* the attempt counts for a given subtask over time always form a continuous series starting at 0\r\n\r\nBut I'm quite interested in what other people think about this.\n\n## Linked Issue(s)\n\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\n## Modified method(s)\n\nThe code changes in this git diff are not located within any method body.\n\n## Summary of Modified Classes\n\nThe summaries of the modified classes before the change of the git diff are described as follows:\nYARNFileReplicationITCase: Creates a test case for YARN file replication in Flink.\nThe summaries of the modified classes after the change of the git diff are described as follows:\nYARNFileReplicationITCase: Creates a test case for YARN file replication in Flink.\n\n\n## Relative Importance of Changed Files\n\nThe relative importance of the changed files is provided below.

The changes include adding a new `DataInputStream` field, modifying the method to use this field, and adding a check for the end of the stream.\n\nThe changes also include adding a check for the end of the stream in the `readString()` method.

This is important because the `readString()` method is used to read a string from the input stream, and it is possible for the stream to end unexpectedly. By adding a check for the end of the stream, the method can handle this situation and throw an `EOFException` instead of throwing a `NullPointerException`.\n\n# Commit Message\n\n{\n\"type\": \"fix\",\n\"subject\": \"Fixed potential null pointer exception in readString() method\",\n\"body\": \"The readString() method in PFMInputStream class has been modified to check for the end of the stream. This change improves the robustness of the class by preventing potential null pointer exceptions.\"\n}"}]

The method determines the cluster group for the current context, considering whether it's local, replicated, or distributed. The changes aim to improve the logic of the method by adding more conditions to handle different scenarios.\n\nThe changes include the removal of a previous implementation and the addition of new code to handle local and replicated data nodes.

This line is added to the class to import the `Collections` class from the `java.util` package. The commit also removes a line of code in the `getExceptions()` method, replacing it with a new line that returns an empty list if the `exceptions` list is null. Additionally, the `hasExceptions()` method is modified to return true if the `exceptions` list is not empty.\n\nThe changes are made to the `DefaultMavenExecutionResult` class, which is responsible for handling Maven execution results, including project, artifacts, and exceptions. The class is used to create a Maven execution result object to hold project information and exceptions.\n\n# Why\n\nThe changes are made to improve the functionality of the `DefaultMavenExecutionResult` class. The addition of the `Collections` class is likely to provide a way to handle collections of exceptions in a more efficient and convenient manner. The modification of the `getExceptions()` method is likely to provide a way to handle the case where the `exceptions` list is null, by returning an empty list instead of throwing a null pointer exception. The modification of the `hasExceptions()` method is likely to provide a way to check if there are any exceptions in the system, by checking if the `exceptions` list is not empty.\n\n# Commit Message\n\n{\n\"type\": \"fix\",\n\"subject\": \"Improved exception handling in DefaultMavenExecutionResult\",\n\"body\": \"This commit improves the exception handling in the DefaultMavenExecutionResult class by adding a new line of code to import the Collections class and modifying the getExceptions() and hasExceptions() methods to handle the case where the exceptions list is null.

The changes involve the `doRequest` method, which is responsible for processing a HTTP request and generating a response. The method handles various aspects of the request, including security checks, event handling, and view rendering.\n\nThe changes include the removal of two lines of code that set session attributes `_SAVED_VIEW_NAME_` and `_SAVED_VIEW_PARAMS_`, and the addition of new code that checks if the last view is the same as the current view and if `saveCurrentView` is false. If these conditions are met, the code sets the session attributes again.\n\n# Why\n\nThe changes aim to improve the functionality of the `doRequest` method by ensuring that the session attributes are updated correctly. The removal of the two lines of code simplifies the method and reduces the risk of errors. The addition of the new code ensures that the session attributes are updated only when necessary, which improves the performance and reliability of the system.\n\n# Commit Message\n\n{\n\"type\": \"fix\",\n\"subject\": \"Fixed session attribute updates in RequestHandler\",\n\"body\": \"This commit fixes the session attribute updates in the RequestHandler class.

The `writeWindowUpdate` method is modified to remove a line of code that was writing a frame to the socket wrapper.\n\nThe changes are highlighted in the Git diff, with added lines marked as `ADDED CODE LINE` and removed lines marked as `REMOVED CODE LINE`. The `UNCHANGED LINE` indicates lines that have not been changed.\n\n# Why\n\nThe changes are likely made to improve the performance and reliability of the `Http2UpgradeHandler` class. The addition of the `socketWrapper.flush(true)` line in the `writeBody` method may help to ensure that the socket wrapper is properly flushed after writing the body of the stream, which could improve the overall performance of the system. The removal of the line of code in the `writeWindowUpdate` method may simplify the code and reduce the risk of errors.\n\n# Commit Message\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"fix\",\n  \"subject\": \"Improved performance and reliability of Http2UpgradeHandler\",\n  \"body\": \"This commit improves the performance and reliability of the Http2UpgradeHandler class by adding a new line of code to flush the socket wrapper after writing the body of the stream and removing a line of code that was writing a frame to the socket wrapper.

The method is used to convert the given properties to a string. The `store` method is now added with a new implementation that uses a `ByteArrayOutputStream` to store the properties. The old implementation of the `store` method is deleted.\n\nThe `SuperProperties` class is also modified to create a new `Properties` object with default property values. The `SuperPropertiesTest` class is updated to test the functionality of the `SuperProperties` class.\n\nThe `LINE_SEPARATOR` constant is updated to use a newline character (`\\n`) instead of the system property `line.separator`.\n\n# Why\n\nThe changes in this commit are made to improve the functionality of the `SuperProperties` class. The addition of the `store` method allows for the conversion of properties to a string, which can be useful for serializing properties. The deletion of the old implementation of the `store` method removes a redundant method that is no longer needed.\n\nThe update to the `LINE_SEPARATOR` constant is made to ensure consistency in the use of newline characters throughout the code.\n\n# Commit Message\n\n{\n\"type\": \"fix\",\n\"subject\": \"Fixed serialization of properties in SuperProperties\",\n\"body\": \"This commit fixes the serialization of properties in SuperProperties by adding a new implementation of the store method.

The method was previously returning a session factory that creates new sessions of type `QuickStartSession`. However, the changes introduced by this commit modify the method to return a session factory that creates a new session for each request. The method's implementation details have also been updated to reflect this change.\n\nThe changes also include the addition of the `Request` class import and the modification of the `newSession` method to accept a `Request` object as a parameter.\n\n# Why\n\nThe motivation behind this change is to improve the session management in the `QuickStartApplication` class. The previous implementation of the `getSessionFactory` method was creating sessions of type `QuickStartSession` which may not be suitable for all requests. By creating a new session for each request, the application can better handle different types of requests and provide a more robust session management system.\n\n# Commit Message\n\n{\n\"type\": \"feat\",\n\"subject\": \"Introduce request-based session creation\",\n\"body\": \"The `getSessionFactory` method in `QuickStartApplication` has been modified to return a session factory that creates a new session for each request.
