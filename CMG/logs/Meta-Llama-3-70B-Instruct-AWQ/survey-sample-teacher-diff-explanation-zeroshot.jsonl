The `addNormalized` method is likely responsible for normalizing the RDN before adding it to the `farthest` collection.\n\n**Reasoning:** The reason for this change might be to ensure that RDNs are consistently normalized when added to the `farthest` collection, which could be important for subsequent processing or comparison operations.\n\n## Modified method(s)\n\nHere are the summaries for all changed methods in this git diff in the commit url. For each method's before and after change versions, the summaries summarize it from five different perspectives: \n\nWhat: Describes the functionality of a method\nWhy: Explains the reason why a method is provided or the design rationale of the method\nHow-to-use: Describes the usage or the expected set-up of using a method\nHow-it-is-done: Describes the implementation details of a method\nProperty: Asserts properties of a method including pre-conditions or post-conditions of a method\n\nMethod public LdapDN getFarthestReferralAncestor(LdapDN dn) is modified by this git diff.\nThe method summaries before the commit are:\nWhat: finds and returns the farthest referral ancestor of a given LDAP DN .\nWhy: finds the farthest ancestor of the given DN that is a referral, used in LDAP referral handling.\nHow-to-use: returns the farthest ancestor of the given DN that is a referral .\nHow-it-is-done: finds the farthest ancestor of the given DN that is a referral .\nProperty: returns the farthest ancestor of the given dn that is a referral, or null if no such ancestor exists .\n\n\nHere's how each aspect of the method will change after the changes are applied:\n\n**What:** No change. The method still finds and returns the farthest referral ancestor of a given LDAP DN.\n\n**Why:** No change. The method is still used in LDAP referral handling to find the farthest ancestor of the given DN that is a referral.\n\n**How-to-use:** No change. The method is still used in the same way, passing an LDAP DN as an argument, and it returns the farthest ancestor of the given DN that is a referral.\n\n**How-it-is-done:** The method now uses `addNormalized` instead of `add` to add the RDN to the `farthest` LdapDN. This means that the RDN will be normalized before being added, which may affect the outcome of the method if the input DN contains non-normalized RDNs.\n\n**Property:** The post-condition of the method remains the same, i.e., it returns the farthest ancestor of the given DN that is a referral, or null if no such ancestor exists. However, the normalization of RDNs may affect the result in certain cases, e.g., if the input DN contains non-normalized RDNs that would be considered equal after normalization.\n\n## Linked Issue(s)\n\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\n## Relative Importance of Changed Files\n\nThe relative importance of the changed files is provided below.

If it does, it retrieves the value and assigns it to `locator`. If not, it creates a new `DocumentLocator` instance and puts it in the map.\n\nThe changed code simplifies this process by directly trying to retrieve the value from the map using `locators.get(key)`. If the key is not present, `get()` returns null, which is then checked using an `if` statement.\n\n2. **Reordered logic**: The original code had an `if` statement to check if the key is present in the map, and if so, it retrieves the value. If not, it creates a new instance and puts it in the map.\n\nThe changed code reverses this logic. It first tries to retrieve the value from the map using `get()`, and if the result is null, it creates a new instance and puts it in the map.\n\nThe net effect of these changes is that the code is slightly more concise and efficient, as it avoids the unnecessary null initialization and simplifies the logic.\n\n## Summary of Modified Classes\n\nThe summaries of the modified classes before and after the changes are described as follows:\nClass: DocumentLocator\nBefore Changes: Manages document locators based on publication ID, area, path, and language.\nAfter Changes: Manages document locations based on publication ID, area, path, and language.\n\n\n\n## Linked Issue(s)\n\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\n## Modified method(s)\n\nHere are the summaries for all changed methods in this git diff in the commit url.

This ensures that the underlying files are only closed once, even in the presence of concurrent calls to `close()`.\n\n## Linked Issue(s)\n\nHere are the Jira issues linked to this commit:\nIssue ID: CASSANDRA-9531\nTitle: NullPointerException logged when running MessagePayloadTest\nBody: When I run the MessagePayloadTest I have the following error in my log output:\n\njuin 02, 2015 3:27:31 PM com.google.common.cache.LocalCache processPendingNotifications\nAVERTISSEMENT: Exception thrown by removal listener\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat org.apache.cassandra.io.compress.CompressedRandomAccessReader.getTotalBufferSize(CompressedRandomAccessReader.java:260)\n\tat org.apache.cassandra.service.FileCacheService$2.onRemoval(FileCacheService.java:105)\n\tat com.google.common.cache.LocalCache.processPendingNotifications(LocalCache.java:1954)\n\tat com.google.common.cache.LocalCache$Segment.runUnlockedCleanup(LocalCache.java:3457)\n\tat com.google.common.cache.LocalCache$Segment.postWriteCleanup(LocalCache.java:3433)\n\tat com.google.common.cache.LocalCache$Segment.remove(LocalCache.java:3104)\n\tat com.google.common.cache.LocalCache.remove(LocalCache.java:4170)\n\tat com.google.common.cache.LocalCache$LocalManualCache.invalidate(LocalCache.java:4762)\n\tat org.apache.cassandra.service.FileCacheService.invalidate(FileCacheService.java:182)\n\tat org.apache.cassandra.io.util.PoolingSegmentedFile$Cleanup.tidy(PoolingSegmentedFile.java:53)\n\tat org.apache.cassandra.io.util.CompressedPoolingSegmentedFile$Cleanup.tidy(CompressedPoolingSegmentedFile.java:77)\n\tat org.apache.cassandra.utils.concurrent.Ref$GlobalState.release(Ref.java:285)\n\tat org.apache.cassandra.utils.concurrent.Ref$State.ensureReleased(Ref.java:164)\n\tat org.apache.cassandra.utils.concurrent.Ref.ensureReleased(Ref.java:89)\n\tat org.apache.cassandra.utils.concurrent.SharedCloseableImpl.close(SharedCloseableImpl.java:45)\n\tat org.apache.cassandra.io.sstable.format.SSTableReader$InstanceTidier$1.run(SSTableReader.java:1937)\n\tat java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:471)\n\tat java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:262)\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor$ScheduledFutureTask.access$201(ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.java:178)\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor$ScheduledFutureTask.run(ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.java:292)\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1145)\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:615)\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\n\n\nThe problem is due to the fact that when getTotalBufferSize is called the segment has already been desallocated.

A new import statement for `java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicBoolean` has been added. A private field `isClosed` of type `AtomicBoolean` has been introduced to track whether the scanner has been closed. The `close()` method has been modified to use the `isClosed` field to ensure that the underlying files are only closed once, even in the presence of concurrent calls to `close()`.\n\n# Why\n\nThe changes are motivated by the need to prevent multiple closes of the underlying files, which can lead to `NullPointerException` as seen in the linked Jira issue CASSANDRA-9531. The issue arises when the `close()` method is called multiple times, causing the segment to be deallocated prematurely. The introduction of the `isClosed` field and the modified `close()` method ensures that the closing operation is thread-safe and idempotent.\n\n# Commit Message\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"fix\",\n    \"subject\": \"Prevent multiple closes of underlying files in BigTableScanner\",\n    \"body\": \"Introduce an AtomicBoolean field to track whether the scanner has been closed and modify the close() method to ensure that the underlying files are only closed once, even in the presence of concurrent calls to close().

For each method's before and after change versions, the summaries summarize it from five different perspectives: \n\nWhat: Describes the functionality of a method\nWhy: Explains the reason why a method is provided or the design rationale of the method\nHow-to-use: Describes the usage or the expected set-up of using a method\nHow-it-is-done: Describes the implementation details of a method\nProperty: Asserts properties of a method including pre-conditions or post-conditions of a method\n\nMethod protected void marshalToOutputStream(Marshaller ms, Object obj, OutputStream os, Annotation[] anns, MediaType mt) throws Exception is modified by this git diff.\nThe method summaries before the commit are:\nWhat: marshals the object to an output stream using JAXB and XSLT transformation .\nWhy: marshals an object to an output stream using JAXB and XSLT templates, with fallback to JAXB only if XSLT templates are not available .\nHow-to-use: marshals an object to an output stream using JAXB and XSLT transformation.\nHow-it-is-done: marshals an object to an output stream using JAXB and XSLT templates, with support for minimum escape handling and custom system IDs.\nProperty: marshals the given object to the output stream using JAXB and XSLT templates, handling exceptions and setting up the transformer handler .\n\n\nHere's how each aspect of the method will change after the changes are applied:\n\n**What:** The method will still marshal the object to an output stream using JAXB and XSLT transformation. However, the way the `Result` object is created will change. Instead of always creating a `StreamResult` object, it will now use a custom `getStreamResult` method that takes into account the annotations and media type. This might allow for more flexibility in how the output stream is handled.\n\n**Why:** The reason why this method is provided remains the same: to marshal an object to an output stream using JAXB and XSLT templates, with fallback to JAXB only if XSLT templates are not available. The change is an implementation detail that doesn't affect the overall purpose of the method.\n\n**How-to-use:** The usage of the method remains the same. The caller still needs to provide the marshaller, object, output stream, annotations, and media type. However, the caller might need to ensure that the `getStreamResult` method is properly configured to handle the output stream correctly.\n\n**How-it-is-done:** The internal implementation of the method will change slightly. Instead of directly creating a `StreamResult` object, it will now use the `getStreamResult` method to create the `Result` object. This might involve additional logic or configuration that is not present in the original implementation.\n\n**Property:** The properties of the method remain largely the same. It still marshals the given object to the output stream using JAXB and XSLT templates, handling exceptions and setting up the transformer handler. However, the custom `getStreamResult` method might introduce additional properties or constraints that need to be considered. For example, the `getStreamResult` method might have its own set of preconditions or postconditions that need to be met.Method protected Result getStreamResult(OutputStream os, Annotation[] anns, MediaType mt) throws Exception is newly added by this git diff.\nIts summaries are: \nWhat: returns a stream result that writes to the provided output stream.\nWhy: returns a StreamResult that writes to the provided OutputStream, used for marshalling JAXB objects to a stream.\nHow-to-use: used to handle the output of a JAXB marshaller to a stream.\nHow-it-is-done: returns a StreamResult object that wraps the provided OutputStream, allowing the marshaller to write the marshalled output to the stream.\nProperty: returns a StreamResult that writes to the provided OutputStream, used for marshalling JAXB objects to a stream.\n\n\n## Git Diff\n\n\ndiff --git a/rt/frontend/jaxrs/src/main/java/org/apache/cxf/jaxrs/provider/XSLTJaxbProvider.java b/rt/frontend/jaxrs/src/main/java/org/apache/cxf/jaxrs/provider/XSLTJaxbProvider.java\nindex e91f88e33d..5c03be4e9e 100644\n--- a/rt/frontend/jaxrs/src/main/java/org/apache/cxf/jaxrs/provider/XSLTJaxbProvider.java\n+++ b/rt/frontend/jaxrs/src/main/java/org/apache/cxf/jaxrs/provider/XSLTJaxbProvider.java\n@@ -337,6 +337,10 @@ public class XSLTJaxbProvider<T> extends JAXBElementProvider<T> {\n         // complete\n     }\n \n+    protected Result getStreamResult(OutputStream os, Annotation[] anns, MediaType mt) throws Exception {\n+        return new StreamResult(os);\n+    }\n+    \n     @Override\n     protected void marshalToOutputStream(Marshaller ms, Object obj, OutputStream os,\n                                          Annotation[] anns, MediaType mt)\n@@ -356,7 +360,7 @@ public class XSLTJaxbProvider<T> extends JAXBElementProvider<T> {\n             th = factory.newTransformerHandler(ti.getTemplates());\n             this.trySettingProperties(th, ti);\n         }\n-        Result result = new StreamResult(os);\n+        Result result = getStreamResult(os, anns, mt);\n         if (systemId != null) {\n             result.setSystemId(systemId);\n         }\n\n\nLet's break down the changes in this diff:\n\n**Added method: `getStreamResult(OutputStream os, Annotation[] anns, MediaType mt)`**\n\nA new protected method `getStreamResult` has been added to the `XSLTJaxbProvider` class. This method takes three parameters: `OutputStream os`, `Annotation[] anns`, and `MediaType mt`. It returns a `Result` object, specifically a `StreamResult` instance, which is created with the provided `OutputStream` object.\n\n**Changes in `marshalToOutputStream` method**\n\nIn the `marshalToOutputStream` method, the line `Result result = new StreamResult(os);` has been replaced with `Result result = getStreamResult(os, anns, mt);`. This means that instead of directly creating a `StreamResult` object, the new `getStreamResult` method is called to create the `Result` object. This allows for more flexibility and customization in creating the `Result` object, as the `getStreamResult` method can be overridden or modified in subclasses.\n\nIn summary, the changes introduce a new method `getStreamResult` that can be used to create a `Result` object, and modify the `marshalToOutputStream` method to use this new method instead of directly creating a `StreamResult` object.\n\n## Relative Importance of Changed Files\n\nThe relative importance of the changed files is provided below.
