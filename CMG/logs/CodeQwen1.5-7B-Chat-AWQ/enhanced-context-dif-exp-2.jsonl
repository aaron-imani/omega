By adding the triggering condition, the function will now only apply the ReduceByKey operator to the input PCollection after the end of the window.\n\nHow-to-use: This function is called when the ReduceByKey operator is being executed. The user should provide the ReduceByKey operator and a BeamExecutorContext as input to the function.\n\nHow-it-is-done: This is a method that takes a ReduceByKey operator and a BeamExecutorContext as input and returns a PCollection of Pair objects. The function first extracts the key and value from the input PCollection using a MapElements transform. Then, if the ReduceByKey operator is combinable, it applies a Combine.perKey transform to the extracted PCollection. If the ReduceByKey operator is not combinable, it applies a GroupByKey transform to the extracted PCollection and then applies a ParDo transform with a ReduceDoFn to the grouped PCollection.\n\nProperty: This code defines a method called `doTranslate` that takes a `ReduceByKey` operator and a `BeamExecutorContext` as input parameters. The method returns a `PCollection` of `Pair` objects. The method has a property called `combinable` that indicates whether the ReduceByKey operator is combinable or not. If the ReduceByKey operator is combinable, the method applies a Combine.perKey transform to the input PCollection.

This has the following benefits:\r\n\r\n - New code will be checked, even in modules that are not yet passing.\r\n - Code won't as easily backslide in modules that were partially fixed.\r\n - It will produce much more manageable incremental work, and limitless starter bugs!\r\n\r\nI produced the needed warnings (merged in other PRs) by removing the flag and then repeating the following, more or less:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./gradlew compileJava compileTestJava --continue 2>&1 | tee ~/tmp/gradle.log\r\n \r\ncat ~/tmp/gradle.log \\\r\n    | grep -e \"$PWD\"'.*error:.*' \\\r\n    | cut -d : -f 1 \\\r\n    | sort -u \\\r\n    | xargs grep -L -e '^@SuppressWarnings' \\\r\n    | xargs sed -E -i '' 's/^(public +)?((abstract|final) +)?(class|interface)/@SuppressWarnings(\"nullness\") &/'\r\n  \r\n./gradlew spotlessApply\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to still suppress type checking, arguments to `applyJavaNature`:\r\n\r\n1. `generatedClassPatterns` to exclude various generated code that is not annotated with nullness types\r\n2. `classesTriggerCheckerBugs` a map from classes which cannot be analyzed to their checkerframework bug URL\n\nANSWERING FORMAT AND INSTRUCTIONS\nYour commit message must be in the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"the type of the commit\",\n    \"subject\": \"the subject of the commit message\",\n    \"body\": \"the body of the commit message\"\n}\n```\n\n- The subject must be at most 72 characters.

Ignorning message\", version);\" with \"logger.debug(\"Received connection from newer protocol version {}. Ignoring message\", version);\" in line 28, the following aspects of the method will change:\n\nWhat: The changes in what the function does.\n- The function will now log a debug message when it receives a message from a newer protocol version, instead of ignoring it.\n\nWhy: The reason why a method is provided or the design rationale of the method\n- The method is used to receive a message from a peer, and it is important to log the version of the protocol used to send the message. This will help in debugging and tracking the compatibility of the system.\n\nHow-to-use: The usage or the expected set-up of using a method\n- The method is used to receive a message from a peer. The user should set up the input stream and the version before calling the method.\n\nHow-it-is-done: How the function does what it does\n- The function reads the total size of the message, the message ID, the header, the body size, and the body from the input stream. It then reads the body in chunks of CHUNK_SIZE and skips any remaining bytes in the input stream. Finally, it creates a message object and sends it to the messaging service for further processing.\n\nProperty: Properties of a method including pre-conditions or post-conditions of a method.\n- The pre-conditions of the method are that the input stream and the version are not null and that the version is greater than or equal to 0.\n- The post-conditions of the method are that the function returns the message received from the input stream, or null if the message is from a newer protocol version.Method public void run() is modified by this git diff.\nThe method summaries before the commit are:\nWhat: This is a Java method that runs in a separate thread to handle incoming connections from other nodes in a distributed system.

Ignorning\");\" in line 43 will replace the existing log message with a new one.\n\nWhy: The reason why a method is provided or the design rationale of the method\n- The method is a part of the messaging service that handles incoming connections from other nodes in a distributed system. The changes are related to logging the behavior of the method.\n\nHow-to-use: The usage or the expected set-up of using a method\n- This is a thread that is started when a new connection is established. The method reads data from the socket and processes the messages it receives.\n\nHow-it-is-done: How the function does what it does\n- The method reads data from the socket, validates the magic, and processes the messages it receives. If the version of the connection is newer than the current version, it logs a message and ignores the connection.\n\nProperty: Properties of a method including pre-conditions or post-conditions of a method.\n- Pre-conditions: The method expects a valid socket connection and a valid version number.\n- Post-conditions: The method processes the messages it receives and logs any errors or warnings.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe functionality of the modified classes remains the same before and after the changes.\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nHere is the associated pull request(s):\nThere is no pull request associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nANSWERING FORMAT AND INSTRUCTIONS\nYour commit message must be in the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"the type of the commit\",\n    \"subject\": \"the subject of the commit message\",\n    \"body\": \"the body of the commit message\"\n}\n```\n\n- The subject must be at most 72 characters.

method is provided or the design rationale of the method\nHow-to-use: Describes the usage or the expected set-up of using a method\nHow-it-is-done: Describes the implementation details of a method\nProperty: Asserts properties of a method including pre-conditions or post-conditions of a method\n\nMethod public Event.SchemaChange announceMigration(QueryState queryState, boolean isLocalOnly) throws RequestValidationException is modified by this git diff.\nThe method summaries before the commit are:\nWhat: announce a migration for the materialized view .\nWhy: announces the migration of the materialized view .\nHow-to-use: called when alter materialized view is called .\nHow-it-is-done: announce a migration of a materialized view .\nProperty: returns a new event that announces that a materialized view has been updated .\n\n\nAfter applying the given changes, the function will behave as follows:\n\nWhat: The function will now throw an InvalidRequestException with a message that includes the word \"forbidden\" instead of \"Cannot\".\nWhy: The changes in the message will indicate that the default_time_to_live for a materialized view is forbidden, rather than being unable to be set or altered.\nHow-to-use: The function will still be called when alter materialized view is called.\nHow-it-is-done: The function will still announce a migration of a materialized view.\nProperty: The function will still return a new event that announces that a materialized view has been updated.Method public void testAlterMvWithTTL() throws Throwable is modified by this git diff.\nThe method summaries before the commit are:\nWhat: test alter materialized view with ttl\nWhy: test case to ensure altering materialized view with TTL is not allowed\nHow-to-use: test that altering a materialized view with TTL is not allowed\nHow-it-is-done: test altering materialized view with TTL .\nProperty: test alter materialized view with ttl\n\n\nAs per the changes applied, the function `testAlterMvWithTTL` will behave as follows:\n\nWhat: The changes in what the function does.\n- A new `executeNet` call is added after line 9 to set the current keyspace.\n- A new `executeNet` call is added after line 10 to create a new materialized view with a different TTL.\n- A new `executeNet` call is added after line 16 to alter the materialized view with a different TTL.\n- A new `assertEquals` call is added after line 22 to check the error message when trying to alter the materialized view with a TTL.\n- The replacement of `executeNet(protocolVersion, \"ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW %s WITH default_time_to_live = 30\");` with `execute(\"USE \" + keyspace());` in line 14 is not applicable as `executeNet` is used to execute CQL commands over the network, while `execute` is used to execute CQL commands locally.\n\nWhy: The reason why a method is provided or the design rationale of the method\n- The addition of new `executeNet` calls is to test the behavior of altering a materialized view with TTL.\n- The addition of a new `assertEquals` call is to check the error message when trying to alter the materialized view with a TTL.\n\nHow-to-use: The usage or the expected set-up of using a method\n- The user needs to have the necessary permissions to create and alter tables and views.\n- The user needs to have the necessary permissions to execute CQL commands over the network.\n\nHow-it-is-done: How the function does what it does\n- The function creates a table with a default TTL of 60 seconds.\n- The function creates a materialized view with a default TTL of 60 seconds.\n- The function attempts to alter the materialized view with a different TTL of 30 seconds, which should fail because materialized views always inherit the TTL of the parent table.\n- The function checks the error message to ensure that the TTL cannot be changed for a materialized view.\n\nProperty: Properties of a method including pre-conditions or post-conditions of a method.\n- Pre-conditions: The user needs to have the necessary permissions to create and alter tables and views.\n- Post-conditions: The materialized view should not have a different TTL than the parent table.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe summaries of the modified classes before and after the changes are described as follows:\nClass: AlterViewStatement\nBefore Changes: Creates a new instance of the AlterViewStatement class with the given CFName and TableAttributes.\nAfter Changes: Handles the alteration of a materialized view in Cassandra.\n\n\n\nHere is

Added a conditional block after line 113 in the file `PasswordHashingInterceptor`.

This ensures that any additional shutdown logic defined in the superclass is executed before the Kafka cluster and Zookeeper are shut down.\n\nWhy: The reason why a method is provided or the design rationale of the method\n- The provided method is designed to shut down a Kafka cluster and its associated Zookeeper instance. It iterates through a list of Kafka brokers, shuts them down one by one, and then clears the list of brokers. It also stops the Zookeeper instance if it exists. Finally, it deletes temporary directories used for Kafka and Zookeeper if they exist.\n\nHow-to-use: The usage or the expected set-up of using a method\n- To use this method, you would create an instance of the class that contains this method and call the shutdown method on that instance. For example:\n```\nKafkaCluster cluster = new KafkaCluster();\ncluster.shutdown();\n```\n\nHow-it-is-done: How the function does what it does\n- The function iterates through a list of Kafka brokers, shuts them down one by one, and then clears the list of brokers.

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, recovery with rescaled channel state is failing. This PR enhances `StateAssignmentOperation` to reassignment channel state and create a channel state mapping, where channels before rescaling are mapped to channels after rescaling.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Refactors `StateAssignmentOperation` in preparation. In particular, it adds a two pass approach such that vertex may assign state of other vertexes.\r\n- Adds `ChannelStateRescaler` to define rescaling behavior of in-flight data.\r\n- Adds two properties to `StreamPartitioner` to return the `ChannelStateRescaler` for upstream and downstream side.\r\n- Add upstream and downstream `ChannelStateRescaler`s to `JobEdge`, such that it is accessible to `StateAssignmentOperation`.\r\n- Adding channel reassignment to `StateAssignmentOperation`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests. The final rescale PRs will also adapt `UnalignedCheckpointITCase` to cover rescaling.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

It's really just a simple Map<ExecutionVertexID, Integer> which ties a specific vertex+subtask to an attempt count.\r\n\r\nCounts are set when an execution is registered at the EG, and retrieved when the ExecutionVertex creates a new Execution. The current attempt count is also still stored in the Execution, making the change less invasive (for example, resetForNewExecution continues to work without modifications).\r\n\r\n\r\nOne thing is that, as is, the semantics when it comes to rescaling are a bit funky.\r\nScaleUp:\r\nIf you begin with p=1 and an attempt count of 4, and then rescale to p=2, then what should the attempt count be for both subtasks?\r\nIn this version the attempt count for subtask 1 would be retained, while subtask 2 starts at 0.\r\nSetting both to 0 would also make sense, but if we downscale again to p=1 then it would be nice if the attempt count had some relation to the original count.\r\nAlternatively we could try to derive the attempt count for subtask 2 from other subtasks; in this example the obvious choice would be 2, because we're just replicating subtask 1.\r\n\r\nScaleDown:\r\nThe main issue arises when scaling down where the subtask with the largest index has the highest attempt count; currently this count would be lost. So you have p=2, and subtask 2 has an attempt count of 4, and now you scale down to p=1. The attempt count would now be solely determined by subtask 1, although we in essence just merged the two.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, I don't think resetting attempt counts to 0 is an option, because they can be used to gauge the health of a vertex, and we'd run into collisions within metrics if we ever re-use a subtask+attempt combination.\r\n\r\nThe current approach is by far the simplest, and is the only option iff we want to adhere to these rules:\r\n* every combination of subtask + attempt count is only used once\r\n* the attempt counts for a given subtask over time always form a continuous series starting at 0\r\n\r\nBut I'm quite interested in what other people think about this.\n\nANSWERING FORMAT AND INSTRUCTIONS\nYour commit message must be in the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"the type of the commit\",\n    \"subject\": \"the subject of the commit message\",\n    \"body\": \"the body of the commit message\"\n}\n```\n\n- The subject must be at most 72 characters.

The use of a buffer can improve the performance of the copy operation by reducing the number of system calls and by allowing the data to be copied in chunks.\n- The method is designed to be static, meaning that it can be called without creating an instance of the class.

For example:\n  ```\n  copy(source, destination, true);\n  ```\n\nHow-it-is-done: copy method to copy data from source to destination using a buffer or not .\n- The method uses the CopyUtils.copy method to copy the contents of the source to the sourceBos if the useBuffer parameter is true.

The `log` method is expected to\nHow-to-use: test method that logs a message using the log4j2 API and checks the output.\nHow-it-is-done: test the logging functionality in an osgi context .\nProperty: This is a test method that tests the logging functionality in an OSGi context. The method installs three bundles: the API bundle, the core bundle\n\n\nWhat: The changes in what the function does.\n- The addition of the `@Ignore` annotation will cause the test to be skipped if it fails. This is useful for temporarily disabling a test that is known to fail.\n- The changes in the `log` method call will now use the `log4j2` API instead of the `log4j` API. This may require changes to the `log` method itself.\n\nWhy: The reason why a method is provided or the design rationale of the method\n- The addition of the `@Ignore` annotation is to address a known issue that occurs locally (for Gary Gregory) and on Travis CI. It is unclear why the test passes on Jenkins.\n\nHow-to-use: The usage or the expected set-up of using a method\n- The test method `testSimpleLogInAnOsgiContext` is expected to be run in an OSGi environment. It installs three bundles: the API bundle, the core bundle, and the dummy bundle. It then starts all three bundles, logs a message using the `log4j2` API, and checks the output. Finally, it stops and uninstalls all three bundles.\n\nHow-it-is-done: How the function does what it does\n- The `log` method is expected to log a message using the `log4j2` API. It is unclear what the `log` method does currently, but it is assumed that it logs a message using the `log4j` API.\n\nProperty: Properties of a method including pre-conditions or post-conditions of a method.\n- The pre-conditions of the `log` method are that the `dummy` bundle is installed and started. The post-conditions of the `log` method are that the message is logged using the `log4j2` API and that the output is checked.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe functionality of the modified classes remains the same before and after the changes.\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nHere is the associated pull request(s):\nThere is no pull request associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nANSWERING FORMAT AND INSTRUCTIONS\nYour commit message must be in the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"the type of the commit\",\n    \"subject\": \"the subject of the commit message\",\n    \"body\": \"the body of the commit message\"\n}\n```\n\n- The subject must be at most 72 characters.

The replacement of line 48 with \"? 0.000001 : BaseTestNumeric.DIFF_TOLERANCE_FACTOR;\" will change the tolerance used in the comparison of numeric cell values. The replacement of line 49 with \"BaseTestNumeric.assertDouble(msg, expValue.getNumericCellValue(), actValue.getNumberValue(), BaseTestNumeric.POS_ZERO, tolerance);\" will change the comparison of numeric cell values.\n\nHow-to-use: This is a JUnit test method that tests the functionality of a specific function in a spreadsheet. The method takes three parameters: the name of the function, the index of the formulas row, and the index of the expected values row. The method assumes that the formulas row contains formulas that need to be evaluated, and the expected values row contains the expected results of the evaluation. The method compares the actual results of the evaluation with the expected results and asserts that they match.\n\nHow-it-is-done: The method first retrieves the formulas row and the expected values row from the spreadsheet. It then iterates over each cell in the formulas row, evaluates the formula, and compares the result with the corresponding cell in the expected values row. If the result matches the expected value, the method continues to the next cell. If the result does not match the expected value, the method fails the test with an appropriate error message.\n\nProperty: This is a JUnit test method that processes a row of formulas in a spreadsheet and compares the results with expected values.

However, it does not check whether the servlet mapping is actually removed from the web.xml file. The changes add an assertion to check that the servlet mapping is not present in the web.xml file after the processing is complete.\n\nAspect: How-to-use\nThe usage of the test case remains the same. The test case can be run as any other unit test. It is recommended to run the test case after making changes to the ContextConfig class to ensure that the changes have been implemented correctly.\n\nAspect: How-it-is-done\nThe changes to the test case involve adding an assertion to check that the servlet mapping is not present in the web.xml file after the processing is complete. This is done by calling the getServlets method of the WebXml object and checking that the servlet mapping with the name \"param\" is not present in the returned ServletDef list.\n\nAspect: Property\nThe property of the test case is that it tests the behavior of the ContextConfig class when it encounters duplicate servlet mappings in a web.xml file. The test case is also testing the behavior of the WebXml object after the processing is complete.

It will test whether duplicate filter mappings are allowed or not.\n\nAspect: Why\nThe reason for the changes is to ensure that the function behaves as expected. It is important to test the function thoroughly to ensure that it behaves as intended.\n\nAspect: How-to-use\nThe usage of the function is the same as before. It is a test case that can be run to verify the behavior of the function.\n\nAspect: How-it-is-done\nThe function will still process the annotations file and check for duplicate filter mappings. If a duplicate filter mapping is found, an IllegalArgumentException will be thrown. If no duplicate filter mapping is found, the function will continue as before.\n\nAspect: Property\nThe property of the function is that it will handle duplicate filter mappings correctly.

This is because the original code was setting the `CATALINA_BASE` property to the value of `CATALINA_HOME` if it was null, which may not be the desired behavior in all cases.\n\nHow-to-use: This method is used to initialize the base directory for the Tomcat server. If the `CATALINA_HOME` property is not null, the function will set the `CATALINA_BASE` property to the value of `CATALINA_HOME`. If the `CATALINA_HOME` property is null, the function will not set the `CATALINA_BASE` property.\n\nHow-it-is-done: The function initializes the base directory for the server by first checking if the `CATALINA_HOME` property is not null. If it is not null, the function sets the `CATALINA_BASE` property to the value of `CATALINA_HOME`. If the `CATALINA_HOME` property is null, the function does not set the `CATALINA_BASE` property.\n\nProperty: The property of the function is that it initializes the base directory for the server. The function sets the `CATALINA_BASE` property to the value of `CATALINA_HOME` if it is not null, and does not set the `CATALINA_BASE` property if it is null.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe functionality of the modified classes remains the same before and after the changes.\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nHere is the associated pull request(s):\nThere is no pull request associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nANSWERING FORMAT AND INSTRUCTIONS\nYour commit message must be in the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"the type of the commit\",\n    \"subject\": \"the subject of the commit message\",\n    \"body\": \"the body of the commit message\"\n}\n```\n\n- The subject must be at most 72 characters.

It first checks if there are any buffered writes and if\nHow-it-is-done: write data to the socket in non-blocking manner\nProperty: write non blocking\n\n\nWhat: The changes will not affect the behavior of the method. The method is already designed to write a portion of a string to the socket in a non-blocking manner. The only change is the addition of a break statement after line 15.\n\nWhy: The addition of the break statement will not affect the behavior of the method. The break statement will only exit the loop if the length of the remaining data to be written is less than or equal to 0. Since the length of the remaining data to be written is being decremented by the value of thisTime in each iteration of the loop, the break statement will only exit the loop if the length of the remaining data to be written is less than or equal to 0.\n\nHow-to-use: This method is used to write data to the socket in a non-blocking manner. It first checks if there are any buffered writes and if the write buffer is writable. If it is, the method configures the write buffer for write and transfers the data from the input buffer to the write buffer. It then enters a loop that writes the data to the socket in non-blocking manner. If the length of the remaining data to be written is less than or equal to 0, the loop will exit.\n\nHow-it-is-done: The method first checks if there are any buffered writes and if the write buffer is writable.

It then enters a loop that writes the data to the socket in non-blocking manner. If the length of the remaining data to be written is less than or equal to 0, the loop will exit.\n\nProperty: The method is designed to write data to the socket in a non-blocking manner.

By abstracting the creation of a `StreamResult` object into a separate method, we can easily modify the behavior of the method without affecting the rest of the code.\n\nHow-to-use: This method is used to marshal an object to an output stream using JAXB. It takes an object, an array of annotations, a `MediaType`, and an `OutputStream` as parameters. The `OutputStream` is used to write the marshalled object to the output stream.

There was no need to use this tool.\n\nThis is the changed method(s) summaries:\nThe code changes in this git diff are not located within any method body.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe functionality of the modified classes remains the same before and after the changes.\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nHere is the associated pull request(s):\nTitle: Fix newRemoteAddr is never assigned\nBody: * Using the wrong variable for not null validation before HttpServletRequestXForwardedFilter.newRemoteAddr assignment.\r\n\r\nThat way, the header **_X-Forwarded-For_**, passed from AbstractHTTPServlet.checkXForwardedHeaders() was never considered.\n\nANSWERING FORMAT AND INSTRUCTIONS\nYour commit message must be in the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"the type of the commit\",\n    \"subject\": \"the subject of the commit message\",\n    \"body\": \"the body of the commit message\"\n}\n```\n\n- The subject must be at most 72 characters. It should contain a brief summary of the changes introduced by the commit. You must use **imperative mood** to write the subject. Do not repeat the type in the subject.\n- The body is optional but strongly recommended. It should comprehensively provide additional relevant contextual information about **all** the changes made and/or justifications/motivations behind them. It must be written as detailed as possible. If you do not provide a body, you should use an empty string for its value. You are strongly encouraged to provide a body based on all the provided context.\n- Body should not include code blocks or snippets.\n- Do not write generic/uniformative/useless sentences in body. Provide only important and relevant information.\n- The type is the software maintenance activity type of the commit that should be determined based on the commit changes, commit message body and subject. The type must be exactly one of the following: feat, fix, style, refactor.  No other values are acceptable. The definitions of these activities are given below:\nfeat: introducing NEW features into the system. (feat is short for feature)\nfix: FIXING faults or software bugs.\nstyle: code FORMAT changes such as fixing redundant white-space, adding missing semi-colons, and similar changes.\nrefactor: changes made to the INTERNAL STRUCTURE of software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behavior.\n- Type should not be repeated in the subject. Remember, type should be determined based on the commit changes, commit message body and subject.\n\n\nEND OF COMMIT CONTEXT\n\nYour commit message: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n    \"type\": \"fix\",\n    \"subject\": \"Fix newRemoteAddr is never assigned\",\n    \"body\": \"The variable newRemoteAddr is never assigned in AbstractHTTPServlet.checkXForwardedHeaders().
