It tests the precision updates of the TimelineMetricCache by creating a mock configuration\nWhy:  This is a JUnit test for the TimelineMetricCache class, which is responsible for caching and retrieving timeline metrics for a given app\nHow-to-use:  This is a JUnit test for a TimelineMetricCache, which is a cache for storing time-series data of metrics for a specific application\nHow-it-is-done:  This is a JUnit test for the TimelineMetricCache class.

It creates a TimelineMetric object with a set of metric values for a specific metric\n\n\n What: The change in the method will be the type of the `valueMap` variable from `Map<String, TimelineMetric>` to `Map<String, TimelineMetric<String, TimelineMetric>>`. This change will not affect the behavior of the method as it is just a type change and does not affect the method's logic.\n\nWhy: The reason for this change is not provided in the given code, but it could be to make the code more consistent with other parts of the codebase or to make the type of the variable more explicit.\n\nHow-to-use: The usage of the method remains the same. The method is a JUnit test for the TimelineMetricCache class, and it tests the precision updates of the TimelineMetricCache by creating a mock configuration.\n\nHow-it-is-done: The method creates a mock configuration and tests the precision updates of the TimelineMetricCache by comparing the cached and new metric values for a specific metric and app. The method uses a TimelineMetric object to store the metric values and a TreeMap to store the metric values in chronological order.\n\nProperty: The properties of the method, such as pre-conditions and post-conditions, are not affected by the change in the type of the `valueMap` variable.

The changes do not affect the usage of the method.\n\nHow-it-is-done: This method is a part of Apache Beam SDK and it is used to perform a reduce by key operation on a PCollection. It takes a ReduceByKey operator and adds the behavior of triggering the window after the watermark has passed the end of the window.\n\nProperty: This method is a generic implementation of the `ReduceByKey` transform for Apache Beam. It takes a `ReduceByKey` operator, and with the changes, it will also trigger the window after the watermark has passed the end of the window. The pre-condition is that the operator and the context are provided, and the post-condition is a PCollection of Pair<KEY, OUT> objects.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe functionality of the modified classes remains the same before and after the changes.\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nHere is the associated pull request(s):\nTitle: [BEAM-3900] Euphoria API\nBody: Euphoria API.

If it does, it appends the compacted row to the SSTableWriter, and increments a counter for the total number of keys written. If the SSTableReader does not intersect with the local ranges, it replaces the compacted SSTable with an empty list, and continues to the next SSTableReader. The method also handles the case where the SSTableReader has indexes, and deletes the indexes for the row being compacted. The method also flushes the indexes for the CFS after the cleanup compaction is complete. The change in the method is that it no longer checks the expected range file size before creating a new SSTableWriter.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe functionality of the modified classes remains the same before and after the changes.\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nHere is the associated pull request(s):\nThere is no pull request associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nANSWERING FORMAT AND INSTRUCTIONS\nYour commit message must be in the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"the type of the commit\",\n    \"subject\": \"the subject of the commit message\",\n    \"body\": \"the body of the commit message\"\n}\n```\n\n- The subject must be at most 72 characters.

It will also add a new `assertEquals` statement to check the error message returned when trying to alter the materialized view with a TTL.\n\nWhy: The reason for the changes is to update the test to use the `execute` method for the `USE` statement and to add a check for the error message returned when trying to alter the materialized view with a TTL.\n\nHow-to-use: The usage of the method remains the same, but the test will now use the `execute` method for the `USE` statement and will check the error message returned when trying to alter the materialized view with a TTL.\n\nHow-it-is-done: The function will still create a table and a materialized view, but it will now use the `execute` method for the `USE` statement and will check the error message returned when trying to alter the materialized view with a TTL.\n\nProperty: The properties of the method remain the same, but the test will now check the error message returned when trying to alter the materialized view with a TTL.

However, it will now also check if the default_time_to_live is set to zero, and if not, it will throw a new exception with a different message.\n\nWhy: The reason for adding the check for default_time_to_live being set to zero is due to CASSANDRA-12868, which requires this check. The reason for replacing the exception message is to provide more specific information about the forbidden default_time_to_live for a materialized view.\n\nHow-to-use: The usage of the method remains the same.

The function will no longer fail if it is unable to access the context without proper authentication, instead it will continue to the next steps.\n\nWhy: The additional comments are being added to provide more context and clarity about the purpose of the test. The change in behavior is being made to test the confidentiality of the LDAP connection in a more robust way, by checking if the function continues to execute even when it is unable to access the context without proper authentication.\n\nHow-to-use: The usage of the function remains the same, it is still a JUnit test for an LDAP service implementation. The test checks the confidentiality of the service by attempting to access the service context without proper authentication and then continues to execute the rest of the test.\n\nHow-it-is-done: The function will still test the LDAP context implementation, but it will now continue to execute even if it is unable to access the context without proper authentication. This is done by replacing the \"fail\" statement with a comment, and adding additional comments to provide more context.\n\nProperty: The pre-condition of the function is still that the LDAP service is properly set up and running. The post-condition is that the function will continue to execute even if it is unable to access the context without proper authentication, and will check if the function is able to create, modify, and delete entries in the LDAP directory. The function will also check if the function is able to find the expected entries in the directory and if the modifications made to the entries are correctly reflected. The function will also check if the entries are correctly deleted from the directory.Method protected void configureLdapServer() is modified by this git diff.\nThe method summaries before the commit are:\nWhat:  sets the LDAP server to require confidentiality for all connections.\nWhy:  This method is used to configure the LDAP server to require confidentiality for all connections.

The method still overrides the `configureLdapServer()` method from a superclass and sets the `confidentialityRequired` property, but the specific code used to do so has changed.\n\nHow-it-is-done: The function will no longer directly set the `confidentialityRequired` property of the `ldapServer` object. Instead, some other code or library will be used to achieve the same goal.\n\nProperty: The property of the method, which is setting the LDAP server to require confidentiality for all connections, remains the same.

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, recovery with rescaled channel state is failing. This PR enhances `StateAssignmentOperation` to reassignment channel state and create a channel state mapping, where channels before rescaling are mapped to channels after rescaling.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Refactors `StateAssignmentOperation` in preparation. In particular, it adds a two pass approach such that vertex may assign state of other vertexes.\r\n- Adds `ChannelStateRescaler` to define rescaling behavior of in-flight data.\r\n- Adds two properties to `StreamPartitioner` to return the `ChannelStateRescaler` for upstream and downstream side.\r\n- Add upstream and downstream `ChannelStateRescaler`s to `JobEdge`, such that it is accessible to `StateAssignmentOperation`.\r\n- Adding channel reassignment to `StateAssignmentOperation`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests. The final rescale PRs will also adapt `UnalignedCheckpointITCase` to cover rescaling.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

It's really just a simple Map<ExecutionVertexID, Integer> which ties a specific vertex+subtask to an attempt count.\r\n\r\nCounts are set when an execution is registered at the EG, and retrieved when the ExecutionVertex creates a new Execution. The current attempt count is also still stored in the Execution, making the change less invasive (for example, resetForNewExecution continues to work without modifications).\r\n\r\n\r\nOne thing is that, as is, the semantics when it comes to rescaling are a bit funky.\r\nScaleUp:\r\nIf you begin with p=1 and an attempt count of 4, and then rescale to p=2, then what should the attempt count be for both subtasks?\r\nIn this version the attempt count for subtask 1 would be retained, while subtask 2 starts at 0.\r\nSetting both to 0 would also make sense, but if we downscale again to p=1 then it would be nice if the attempt count had some relation to the original count.\r\nAlternatively we could try to derive the attempt count for subtask 2 from other subtasks; in this example the obvious choice would be 2, because we're just replicating subtask 1.\r\n\r\nScaleDown:\r\nThe main issue arises when scaling down where the subtask with the largest index has the highest attempt count; currently this count would be lost. So you have p=2, and subtask 2 has an attempt count of 4, and now you scale down to p=1. The attempt count would now be solely determined by subtask 1, although we in essence just merged the two.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, I don't think resetting attempt counts to 0 is an option, because they can be used to gauge the health of a vertex, and we'd run into collisions within metrics if we ever re-use a subtask+attempt combination.\r\n\r\nThe current approach is by far the simplest, and is the only option iff we want to adhere to these rules:\r\n* every combination of subtask + attempt count is only used once\r\n* the attempt counts for a given subtask over time always form a continuous series starting at 0\r\n\r\nBut I'm quite interested in what other people think about this.\n\nANSWERING FORMAT AND INSTRUCTIONS\nYour commit message must be in the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"the type of the commit\",\n    \"subject\": \"the subject of the commit message\",\n    \"body\": \"the body of the commit message\"\n}\n```\n\n- The subject must be at most 72 characters.

This means that if the `size` variable is not initialized, the method will not throw an exception and will return whatever value is currently stored in the `size` variable.\n\nThe method will still return the size of the collection, but it will not have the safety check to ensure that the size has been calculated before it is returned. This could potentially lead to incorrect results being returned if the `size` variable has not been initialized.\n\nThe method will still be used in the same way, by calling it to get the size of the collection. However, it is important to note that the method will no longer check if the size has been calculated before it is returned, so it is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that the size has been calculated before calling the method.\n\nThe method will still work in the same way, by returning the size of the list, assuming that the size has been calculated and stored in the instance variable.

If the style attribute contains \"vis\nHow-it-is-done: checks if the vmlshape is visible or not\nProperty: returns true if the shape is visible, false otherwise.\n\n\n After the change is applied, the function's behavior will remain the same in terms of what it does (determines whether the VML shape is visible by checking its style attribute) and how it does it (checks if the vmlshape is visible or not).\n\nHowever, the change will affect the pre-condition of the method. The current pre-condition is that _vmlShape is not null. With the change, the pre-condition will be relaxed to allow _vmlShape to be null, but the method will return false in that case.\n\nThe post-condition will remain the same (returns true if the shape is visible, false otherwise).\n\nThe usage of the method will not change, but the expected set-up will be slightly different. If _vmlShape is null, the method will return false, whereas before it would throw a NullPointerException.Method public ClientAnchor getClientAnchor() is modified by this git diff.\nThe method summaries before the commit are:\nWhat:  This method is overriding the `getClientAnchor()` method of the `XSSFShape` class. It extracts the anchor position\nWhy: returns the client anchor for the VML shape based on the anchor data stored in the shape's client data array.\nHow-to-use:  This method is called to get the client anchor for a VML shape. The client anchor defines the position and size of the shape in the document relative\nHow-it-is-done: This method is used to get the client anchor for a VML shape. The client anchor specifies the position and size of the shape in the client\nProperty: returns the client anchor for this shape, as defined in the VML data.\n\n\n What: The function will now check if the `_vmlShape` is null before returning the client anchor. If `_vmlShape` is null, it will return null instead of throwing a NullPointerException.\nWhy: To prevent a NullPointerException from being thrown if the `_vmlShape` is null.\nHow-to-use: The method can still be used in the same way to get the client anchor for a VML shape, but it will return null if the `_vmlShape` is null.\nHow-it-is-done: The function will first check if the `_vmlShape` is null, and if it is, it will return null. If the `_vmlShape` is not null, it will continue to extract the anchor position and return the client anchor as before.\nProperty: The method will still return the client anchor for this shape, as defined in the VML data, but it will return null if the `_vmlShape` is null. The pre-condition is that the `_vmlShape` is not null, and the post-condition is that if the `_vmlShape` is not null, the method will return the client anchor, and if the `_vmlShape` is null, the method will return null.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe summaries of the modified classes before and after the changes are described as follows:\nClass: XSSFComment\nBefore Changes: Initializes and manages Excel comments in an XLSX file, handling properties such as author, visibility, and location.\nAfter Changes: Initializes and manages an Excel comment in an XSSF (Excel 2007+) spreadsheet model.\n\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nHere is the associated pull request(s):\nThere is no pull request associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nANSWERING FORMAT AND INSTRUCTIONS\nYour commit message must be in the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"the type of the commit\",\n    \"subject\": \"the subject of the commit message\",\n    \"body\": \"the body of the commit message\"\n}\n```\n\n- The subject must be at most 72 characters.

It sets the stage to SERVICE, calls the adapter's asyncDispatch method, and\nHow-it-is-done: This method is responsible for handling the asynchronous dispatch of a request. It sets the stage of the request processor to `org.apache.c\nProperty: This method handles the asynchronous processing of a request and response. It sets the stage to `org.apache.coyote.Constants.\n\n\n What: The function will still process an incoming request asynchronously and return the state of the socket, but it will also set the socket to be synchronous after processing the request in two places (lines 19 and 26).\nWhy: The changes are being made to allow for both synchronous and asynchronous processing of requests, depending on the state of the socket.\nHow-to-use: The method is still used in the same way to handle the asynchronous processing of a request. However, the socket will be set to synchronous after processing the request in two places.\nHow-it-is-done: The method will still set the stage of the request processor to `org.apache.coyote.Constants.STAGE_SERVICE`, call the adapter's asyncDispatch method, and handle errors as before. However, after processing the request, the socket will be set to synchronous in two places (lines 19 and 26).\nProperty: The method still handles the asynchronous processing of a request and response, but it will also set the socket to synchronous after processing the request in two places (lines 19 and 26). The pre-condition is that the method is called with a valid `SocketStatus` object, and the post-condition is that the method returns the state of the socket. The socket will be in a synchronous state after the method is called in two places (lines 19 and 26).\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe functionality of the modified classes remains the same before and after the changes.\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nHere is the associated pull request(s):\nThere is no pull request associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nANSWERING FORMAT AND INSTRUCTIONS\nYour commit message must be in the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"the type of the commit\",\n    \"subject\": \"the subject of the commit message\",\n    \"body\": \"the body of the commit message\"\n}\n```\n\n- The subject must be at most 72 characters.

However, the change in line 16 will affect the flow of the method. Specifically, the method will not call `stream.sentEndOfStream();` and `if (!stream.isActive()) { activeRemoteStreamCount.decrementAndGet(); }` anymore, as these statements are now outside the synchronized block. This means that the end-of-stream flag will not be sent to the stream, and the active remote stream count will not be updated if the stream is not active.\n\nProperty: The method will still write the given data to the given stream, with the given length and finished flag.
