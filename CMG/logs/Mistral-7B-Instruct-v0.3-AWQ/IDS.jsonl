It tests the precision updates of the TimelineMetricCache by creating a mock configuration\nWhy:  This is a JUnit test for the TimelineMetricCache class, which is responsible for caching and retrieving timeline metrics for a given app\nHow-to-use:  This is a JUnit test for a TimelineMetricCache, which is a cache for storing time-series data of metrics for a specific application\nHow-it-is-done:  This is a JUnit test for the TimelineMetricCache class. It tests the precision updates of the TimelineMetricCache by creating a mock configuration\nProperty:  This test checks the precision updates of the TimelineMetricCache. It creates a TimelineMetric object with a set of metric values for a specific metric\n\n\n What: The change in the method will be the type of the `valueMap` variable from `Map<String, TimelineMetric>` to `Map<String, TimelineMetric<String, TimelineMetric>>`. This change will not affect the behavior of the method as it is just a type change and does not affect the method's logic.\n\nWhy: The reason for this change is not provided in the given code, but it could be to make the code more consistent with other parts of the codebase or to make the type of the variable more explicit.\n\nHow-to-use: The usage of the method remains the same. The method is a JUnit test for the TimelineMetricCache class, and it tests the precision updates of the TimelineMetricCache by creating a mock configuration.\n\nHow-it-is-done: The method creates a mock configuration and tests the precision updates of the TimelineMetricCache by comparing the cached and new metric values for a specific metric and app. The method uses a TimelineMetric object to store the metric values and a TreeMap to store the metric values in chronological order.\n\nProperty: The properties of the method, such as pre-conditions and post-conditions, are not affected by the change in the type of the `valueMap` variable. The method still tests the precision updates of the TimelineMetricCache for a specific metric and app, and it checks that the cached and new metric values are equal.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe summaries of the modified classes before and after the changes are described as follows:\nClass: TimelineMetricCacheTest\nBefore Changes: Initializes and manages a self-populating EhCache for storing and updating TimelineMetrics.\nAfter Changes: Creates and tests a self-populating cache for storing and updating TimelineMetrics.\n\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nHere is the associated pull request(s):\nThere is no pull request associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nANSWERING FORMAT AND INSTRUCTIONS\nYour commit message must be in the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"the type of the commit\",\n    \"subject\": \"the subject of the commit message\",\n    \"body\": \"the body of the commit message\"\n}\n```\n\n- The subject must be at most 72 characters.

It sets the date of a Calendar object to February\nHow-it-is-done: This is a test method for the DateUtils class, specifically for the ISO8601_DATE_PATTERN. It creates a Cal\nProperty:  This is a JUnit test method that tests the DateUtils.format() method with the ISO8601 date pattern, using a Calendar\n\n\n What: The test will still test the `format` method of the `DateUtils` class with an example of formatting a date to the ISO 8601 format, but the date being tested will be set on a different Calendar object (`cal` instead of `emailtaskcal`).\nWhy: The reason for the change is not specified in the provided information, but it may be to simplify the test method by using a more generic Calendar object instead of a specific one.\nHow-to-use: The usage of the method remains the same, as it is still a JUnit test method for the DateUtils.format() method with the ISO8601 date pattern.\nHow-it-is-done: The implementation of the test method will change slightly, as the date being set on the Calendar object will now be set on the `cal` object instead of the `emailtaskcal` object.\nProperty: The pre-condition of the test method is that a TimeZone object is created and a Calendar object is instantiated using the given TimeZone. The post-condition is that the DateUtils.format() method is called with the Calendar object and the ISO8601 date pattern, and the result is compared to the expected value \"2002-02-23\". The change in the test method will not affect the properties of the method, as the test is still testing the same functionality.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe functionality of the modified classes remains the same before and after the changes.\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nHere is the associated pull request(s):\nThere is no pull request associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nANSWERING FORMAT AND INSTRUCTIONS\nYour commit message must be in the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"the type of the commit\",\n    \"subject\": \"the subject of the commit message\",\n    \"body\": \"the body of the commit message\"\n}\n```\n\n- The subject must be at most 72 characters.

The addition of the `manager.declareBean()` and `manager.undeclareBean()` methods allows for the creation and removal of beans during the script execution.\n\nHow-to-use: The usage of the method remains the same, but the `beans` map must now contain key-value pairs where the key is a unique identifier for the bean and the value is the object that will be used to represent the bean.\n\nHow-it-is-done: The function will now create a BSFManager object, declare beans for each key-value pair in the `beans` map, execute the script using the BSF, and then undeclare the beans after the script execution.\n\nProperty: The `executeScript` method now takes a script name as a parameter and executes the script using the Bean Scripting Framework (BSF). It also declares and undeclares beans for each key-value pair in the `beans` map. The pre-condition is that the `language` variable must be set and the `beans` map must contain key-value pairs.

After creating the new repository group, it will return the new repository group instead of directly returning the newly created `MavenRepositoryGroup` object. The base directory for the repository group will still be determined by the Archiva configuration, but the new repository group will be created using the name provided in the configuration instead of the id.\n\nWhy: The `updateRepositoryGroupInstance` method is being added to allow for some additional processing to be performed on the new repository group before it is fully created. The change to return the new repository group instead of the `MavenRepositoryGroup` object is being made to allow for further processing to be performed on the new repository group after it is created. The change to use the name provided in the configuration instead of the id is being made to ensure that the name of the repository group is consistent with the name provided in the configuration.\n\nHow-to-use: The method can still be used to create a new RepositoryGroup object based on the provided RepositoryGroupConfiguration, but the new repository group will now be passed to the `updateRepositoryGroupInstance` method before it is returned.\n\nHow-it-is-done: The new repository group will still be created using the base directory specified in the ArchivaConfiguration, but the new repository group will now be created using the name provided in the configuration instead of the id.

It first checks if the CFS is an index, and then gets the local ranges for the table associated with the CFS. It then iterates through the SSTableReaders, and for each one, it creates a CompactionController and checks if the SSTableReader intersects with the local ranges. If it does, it appends the compacted row to the SSTableWriter, and increments a counter for the total number of keys written. If the SSTableReader does not intersect with the local ranges, it replaces the compacted SSTable with an empty list, and continues to the next SSTableReader. The method also handles the case where the SSTableReader has indexes, and deletes the indexes for the row being compacted. The method also flushes the indexes for the CFS after the cleanup compaction is complete.

The test creates a table and a materialized\n\n\n What: The function will still test the behavior of altering a materialized view with a Time-to-Live (TTL) value, but it will now use the `execute` method instead of `executeNet` for the `USE` statement. It will also add a new `assertEquals` statement to check the error message returned when trying to alter the materialized view with a TTL.\n\nWhy: The reason for the changes is to update the test to use the `execute` method for the `USE` statement and to add a check for the error message returned when trying to alter the materialized view with a TTL.\n\nHow-to-use: The usage of the method remains the same, but the test will now use the `execute` method for the `USE` statement and will check the error message returned when trying to alter the materialized view with a TTL.\n\nHow-it-is-done: The function will still create a table and a materialized view, but it will now use the `execute` method for the `USE` statement and will check the error message returned when trying to alter the materialized view with a TTL.\n\nProperty: The properties of the method remain the same, but the test will now check the error message returned when trying to alter the materialized view with a TTL.

However, it will now also check if the default_time_to_live is set to zero, and if not, it will throw a new exception with a different message.\n\nWhy: The reason for adding the check for default_time_to_live being set to zero is due to CASSANDRA-12868, which requires this check. The reason for replacing the exception message is to provide more specific information about the forbidden default_time_to_live for a materialized view.\n\nHow-to-use: The usage of the method remains the same. It is used to announce a migration for a materialized view in Cassandra.\n\nHow-it-is-done: The function will continue to announce a migration for a materialized view, validate the input parameters, create a copy of the view, and update the view's metadata with the new parameters. However, it will now also check if the default_time_to_live is set to zero, and if not, it will throw a new exception with a different message.\n\nProperty: The pre-condition for this method is that the input parameters are valid and the column family is a view. The post-condition is that the view's metadata is updated with the new parameters. The new check for default_time_to_live being set to zero is a new property of the method.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe functionality of the modified classes remains the same before and after the changes.\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nHere are the Jira issues linked to this commit:\nIssue ID: CASSANDRA-16960\nTitle: Improve MV TTL error message\nBody: Old MVs could have been created with a default_time_to_live before the time of CASSANDRA-12868.\nA few years forward customers altering that MV for other reasons might get a very confusing message which can benefit from some clarification.\n\n\r\nALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW XXXXX_view WITH gc_grace_seconds = 10800;\r\n\r\nCannot set or alter default_time_to_live for a materialized view.

The method tests the handling of multiple character events\nWhy: This test checks that the characters from multiple character events are correctly concatenated in the resulting document.\nHow-to-use: This method tests the behavior of the DOMBuilder when multiple character events are passed to it. It creates a DOM document with two character arrays, \"AB\nHow-it-is-done: tests the behavior of the DOMBuilder when multiple character events are passed to it. It checks if the concatenation of the character events is equal to\nProperty: tests that the multiple character events are correctly handled by the DOMBuilder .\n\n\n What: The function will still test the handling of multiple character events for the DOMBuilder class, but it will now store the concatenated characters in a StringBuffer instead of directly comparing them to a hardcoded string.\nWhy: The change in line 13 is to store the concatenated characters in a StringBuffer for further processing, making the test more flexible and reusable. The changes in lines 16, 17, and 18 are to make the test output more readable and informative.\nHow-to-use: The usage of the method remains the same, but the expected output will now be compared to the StringBuffer value instead of a hardcoded string.\nHow-it-is-done: The function will still create a DOM document with two character arrays, \"ABC\" and \"DEF\", and concatenate the characters in the resulting document. However, instead of directly comparing the concatenated characters to a hardcoded string, it will store them in a StringBuffer for further comparison.\nProperty: The pre-condition is that the DOMBuilder class is correctly implemented and the test is run with a valid XML document. The post-condition is that the multiple character events are correctly handled by the DOMBuilder and the concatenated characters are stored in a StringBuffer. The method still tests that the multiple character events are correctly handled by the DOMBuilder, but the way the test verifies the result has changed.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe summaries of the modified classes before and after the changes are described as follows:\nClass: DOMBuilderTestCase\nBefore Changes: Initializes and tests the DOMBuilder class for handling multiple character events in a SAX parser, ensuring that consecutive characters result in separate text nodes.\nAfter Changes: Initializes and tests the DOMBuilder class for proper handling of consecutive character events in XML documents.\n\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nHere is the associated pull request(s):\nThere is no pull request associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nANSWERING FORMAT AND INSTRUCTIONS\nYour commit message must be in the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"the type of the commit\",\n    \"subject\": \"the subject of the commit message\",\n    \"body\": \"the body of the commit message\"\n}\n```\n\n- The subject must be at most 72 characters.

Instead of setting `ldapServer.setConfidentialityRequired( true );`, some other code or library will be used to achieve the same goal.\n\nWhy: The reason for configuring the LDAP server to require confidentiality remains the same, but the method used to achieve this goal has changed.\n\nHow-to-use: The usage of the method remains the same, but the implementation details have changed. The method still overrides the `configureLdapServer()` method from a superclass and sets the `confidentialityRequired` property, but the specific code used to do so has changed.\n\nHow-it-is-done: The function will no longer directly set the `confidentialityRequired` property of the `ldapServer` object. Instead, some other code or library will be used to achieve the same goal.\n\nProperty: The property of the method, which is setting the LDAP server to require confidentiality for all connections, remains the same.

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, recovery with rescaled channel state is failing. This PR enhances `StateAssignmentOperation` to reassignment channel state and create a channel state mapping, where channels before rescaling are mapped to channels after rescaling.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Refactors `StateAssignmentOperation` in preparation. In particular, it adds a two pass approach such that vertex may assign state of other vertexes.\r\n- Adds `ChannelStateRescaler` to define rescaling behavior of in-flight data.\r\n- Adds two properties to `StreamPartitioner` to return the `ChannelStateRescaler` for upstream and downstream side.\r\n- Add upstream and downstream `ChannelStateRescaler`s to `JobEdge`, such that it is accessible to `StateAssignmentOperation`.\r\n- Adding channel reassignment to `StateAssignmentOperation`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests. The final rescale PRs will also adapt `UnalignedCheckpointITCase` to cover rescaling.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

It's really just a simple Map<ExecutionVertexID, Integer> which ties a specific vertex+subtask to an attempt count.\r\n\r\nCounts are set when an execution is registered at the EG, and retrieved when the ExecutionVertex creates a new Execution. The current attempt count is also still stored in the Execution, making the change less invasive (for example, resetForNewExecution continues to work without modifications).\r\n\r\n\r\nOne thing is that, as is, the semantics when it comes to rescaling are a bit funky.\r\nScaleUp:\r\nIf you begin with p=1 and an attempt count of 4, and then rescale to p=2, then what should the attempt count be for both subtasks?\r\nIn this version the attempt count for subtask 1 would be retained, while subtask 2 starts at 0.\r\nSetting both to 0 would also make sense, but if we downscale again to p=1 then it would be nice if the attempt count had some relation to the original count.\r\nAlternatively we could try to derive the attempt count for subtask 2 from other subtasks; in this example the obvious choice would be 2, because we're just replicating subtask 1.\r\n\r\nScaleDown:\r\nThe main issue arises when scaling down where the subtask with the largest index has the highest attempt count; currently this count would be lost. So you have p=2, and subtask 2 has an attempt count of 4, and now you scale down to p=1. The attempt count would now be solely determined by subtask 1, although we in essence just merged the two.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, I don't think resetting attempt counts to 0 is an option, because they can be used to gauge the health of a vertex, and we'd run into collisions within metrics if we ever re-use a subtask+attempt combination.\r\n\r\nThe current approach is by far the simplest, and is the only option iff we want to adhere to these rules:\r\n* every combination of subtask + attempt count is only used once\r\n* the attempt counts for a given subtask over time always form a continuous series starting at 0\r\n\r\nBut I'm quite interested in what other people think about this.\n\nANSWERING FORMAT AND INSTRUCTIONS\nYour commit message must be in the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"the type of the commit\",\n    \"subject\": \"the subject of the commit message\",\n    \"body\": \"the body of the commit message\"\n}\n```\n\n- The subject must be at most 72 characters.

The leader can be a space, a rule, dots, or use the content.\n\n\n After the changes are applied, the behavior of the function will change as follows:\n\nWhat: The function will still add a leader to the document based on the given parameters, but it will now handle cases where the `leaderLengthOptimum` is greater than `leaderLengthMaximum` and less than the remaining width.\n\nWhy: The changes are made to accommodate more scenarios for adding leaders to the document.\n\nHow-to-use: The usage remains the same, but the method will now handle more cases, as mentioned above.\n\nHow-it-is-done: The changes in the code will affect the way the leader length is determined and how the leader is added to the document. For example, the `leaderLength` will now be set to `leaderLengthMaximum` if `leaderLengthOptimum` is greater than both `leaderLengthOptimum` and `remainingWidth`.\n\nProperty: The pre-condition for this method is that the given parameters are valid. The post-condition is that a leader will be added to the document based on the given parameters.

The ClusterGroup represents a\nHow-to-use:  This method returns a ClusterGroup object based on the given boolean value `local`. If `local` is true, it returns the ClusterGroup\nHow-it-is-done: returns the cluster group for local processing or null for remote processing.\nProperty: returns the cluster group for local processing or null if not local processing .\n\n\n What: The function will now return the cluster group for local processing, for replicated data nodes, or for random data nodes if the current context is replicated. If not local, replicated, or a replicated data node, it will return null.\n\nWhy: The changes are made to provide more flexibility in the cluster group selection based on the current context. The addition of the \"if (ctx.isReplicated())\" check allows for the selection of a cluster group for replicated data nodes, and the addition of the \"forDataNodes(ctx.name()).forRandom()\" allows for the selection of a random data node within the replicated context.\n\nHow-to-use: The method still returns a ClusterGroup object based on the given boolean value `local`. However, if `local` is false and the current context is replicated, the method will return a cluster group for a random data node within the replicated context.\n\nHow-it-is-done: The changes are made to the if-condition in line 2, and the addition of a new return statement in line 5. The if-condition now checks if the current context is replicated, and if so, it returns a cluster group for a random data node within the replicated context.\n\nProperty: The pre-condition is that the method requires a ClusterGroup object to be returned, and the post-condition is that the method returns a ClusterGroup object based on the given boolean value `local` and the current context. If the current context is replicated, the method will return a cluster group for a random data node within the replicated context. If not, it will return the cluster group for local processing or null if not local processing.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe functionality of the modified classes remains the same before and after the changes.\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nHere is the associated pull request(s):\nThere is no pull request associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nANSWERING FORMAT AND INSTRUCTIONS\nYour commit message must be in the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"the type of the commit\",\n    \"subject\": \"the subject of the commit message\",\n    \"body\": \"the body of the commit message\"\n}\n```\n\n- The subject must be at most 72 characters.

The comment is added to indicate that the position is being set.\nHow-to-use: The function can be used in the same way as before, but now it will throw an AssertionError if the position is negative.\nHow-it-is-done: The function first checks that the position is non-negative, and if it is, it sets the position of the object.\nProperty: The function sets the current position of the cursor to the specified position, as long as the position is non-negative.

The `assert` statement checks if the `size`\nWhy: returns the size of the collection, which should have been initialized before .\nHow-to-use: This method returns the size of the collection. The size is pre-computed and stored in a private field, so the method runs in constant time\nHow-it-is-done: returns the size of the list, assuming that size has already been calculated and stored in the instance variable.\nProperty:  The `size()` method returns the size of the collection, but it is assumed that the `size` variable has already been initialized and is not\n\n\n After the changes are applied, the method will no longer have the assertion check for the `size` variable being initialized before it is returned. This means that if the `size` variable is not initialized, the method will not throw an exception and will return whatever value is currently stored in the `size` variable.\n\nThe method will still return the size of the collection, but it will not have the safety check to ensure that the size has been calculated before it is returned. This could potentially lead to incorrect results being returned if the `size` variable has not been initialized.\n\nThe method will still be used in the same way, by calling it to get the size of the collection. However, it is important to note that the method will no longer check if the size has been calculated before it is returned, so it is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that the size has been calculated before calling the method.\n\nThe method will still work in the same way, by returning the size of the list, assuming that the size has been calculated and stored in the instance variable. However, the method will no longer have the assertion check to ensure that the size has been calculated before it is returned, so it is important to ensure that the size has been calculated before calling the method.\n\nThe property of the method has changed, as the method no longer has the assertion check to ensure that the size has been calculated before it is returned.

For each method's before and after change versions, the summaries summarize it from five different perspectives: \n\nWhat: Describes the functionality of a method\nWhy: Explains the reason why a method is provided or the design rationale of the method\nHow-to-use: Describes the usage or the expected set-up of using a method\nHow-it-is-done: Describes the implementation details of a method\nProperty: Asserts properties of a method including pre-conditions or post-conditions of a method\n\nMethod public boolean execute(String id) is modified by this git diff.\nThe method summaries before the commit are:\nWhat: deletes a server with the given id and checks if the latest job for that server has completed.\nWhy:  This method is responsible for deleting a server with the given ID from the server services and marking it as deleted. It first retrieves the server\nHow-to-use:  This method is called when a server with the given id is to be deleted. It retrieves the server with the given id, deletes it,\nHow-it-is-done: This method is part of a larger system, but from the code provided, it appears to be a method that deletes a server with the given ID\nProperty: The `execute` method is a part of a functional interface, and it takes a string `id` as an argument. It retrieves the server\n\n\n What: The function will still delete a server with the given id, but it will now use the server's ID to delete it instead of its name. The check for the latest job completion will remain the same.\n\nWhy: The change is made to improve the efficiency of the deletion process by using the server's ID instead of its name, as IDs are unique and can be used to quickly locate the server in the server services.\n\nHow-to-use: The method is still called when a server with the given id is to be deleted.\n\nHow-it-is-done: The method will now use `client.getServerServices().deleteById(server.getId());` instead of `client.getServerServices().deleteByName(server.getName());` to delete the server.\n\nProperty: The `execute` method is still a part of a functional interface, and it takes a string `id` as an argument. It retrieves the server with the given id, deletes it using its ID, and checks if the latest job for that server has completed. The pre-condition is that the `id` is a valid ID for a server in the server services, and the post-condition is that the server is deleted and the latest job for that server is checked for completion.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe functionality of the modified classes remains the same before and after the changes.\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nHere is the associated pull request(s):\nThere is no pull request associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nANSWERING FORMAT AND INSTRUCTIONS\nYour commit message must be in the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"the type of the commit\",\n    \"subject\": \"the subject of the commit message\",\n    \"body\": \"the body of the commit message\"\n}\n```\n\n- The subject must be at most 72 characters. It should contain a brief summary of the changes introduced by the commit. You must use **imperative mood** to write the subject in the present tense. Do not repeat the type in the subject.\n- The body is optional but strongly recommended. It should comprehensively provide additional relevant contextual information about **all** the changes made and/or justifications/motivations behind them. It must be written as detailed as possible. If you do not provide a body, you should use an empty string for its value. You are strongly encouraged to provide a body based on all the provided context.\n- Body should not include code blocks or snippets.\n- Do not write generic/uniformative/useless sentences in body. Provide only important and relevant information.\n- The type is the software maintenance activity type of the commit that should be determined based on the commit changes, commit message body and subject. The type must be exactly one of the following: feat, fix, style, refactor.  No other values are acceptable. The definitions of these activities are given below:\nfeat: introducing NEW features into the system. (feat is short for feature)\nfix: FIXING faults or software bugs.\nstyle: code FORMAT changes such as fixing redundant white-space, adding missing semi-colons, and similar changes.\nrefactor: changes made to the INTERNAL STRUCTURE of software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behavior.\n- Type should not be repeated in the subject.

It should contain a brief summary of the changes introduced by the commit. You must use **imperative mood** to write the subject in the present tense. Do not repeat the type in the subject.\n- The body is optional but strongly recommended. It should comprehensively provide additional relevant contextual information about **all** the changes made and/or justifications/motivations behind them. It must be written as detailed as possible. If you do not provide a body, you should use an empty string for its value. You are strongly encouraged to provide a body based on all the provided context.\n- Body should not include code blocks or snippets.\n- Do not write generic/uniformative/useless sentences in body. Provide only important and relevant information.\n- The type is the software maintenance activity type of the commit that should be determined based on the commit changes, commit message body and subject. The type must be exactly one of the following: feat, fix, style, refactor.  No other values are acceptable. The definitions of these activities are given below:\nfeat: introducing NEW features into the system. (feat is short for feature)\nfix: FIXING faults or software bugs.\nstyle: code FORMAT changes such as fixing redundant white-space, adding missing semi-colons, and similar changes.\nrefactor: changes made to the INTERNAL STRUCTURE of software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behavior.\n- Type should not be repeated in the subject.

It creates\nWhy: This method is used to append a child path to a parent path, while ensuring that the resulting path is properly normalized and does not contain duplicate or unnecessary\nHow-to-use:  This method is used to construct a file path by combining a parent path, a child path, and an optional path adjustment. The method first creates\nHow-it-is-done: This method takes a parent path and a child path, and optionally a path adjustment string, and returns a cleaned version of the combined path.\nProperty: Appends the given childPath to the parentPath, adjusting the path as needed, and returns the resulting path as a string. The path adjust\n\n\n What: The method will still take a parent path, a child path, a path adjustment (optional), and a flag indicating whether to append the paths. However, it will now also check if the cleaned path length is greater than 0 before adjusting the length, and it will add an empty string after the cleaned path.\n\nWhy: The changes are being made to ensure that the method does not modify the path if it is empty, and to add a consistent empty string at the end of the path.\n\nHow-to-use: The usage remains the same as before.\n\nHow-it-is-done: The method will now check if the cleaned path length is greater than 0 before adjusting the length, and it will add an empty string after the cleaned path. The line that sets the length of the cleaned path to the length minus 1 is replaced with a line that sets the length to the original length minus 1.\n\nProperty: The method will still append the given childPath to the parentPath, adjusting the path as needed, and returning the resulting path as a string. However, the path adjustment will now be done only if the cleaned path length is greater than 0. The method will also add an empty string at the end of the path. The pre-condition for the method is that the parentPath, childPath, and pathAdjustment are not null, and the post-condition is that the method returns a normalized path as a string.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe functionality of the modified classes remains the same before and after the changes.\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nHere is the associated pull request(s):\nThere is no pull request associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nANSWERING FORMAT AND INSTRUCTIONS\nYour commit message must be in the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"the type of the commit\",\n    \"subject\": \"the subject of the commit message\",\n    \"body\": \"the body of the commit message\"\n}\n```\n\n- The subject must be at most 72 characters.

It takes an EntityListIterator as a parameter\nHow-to-use:  This method is used to retrieve a list of product IDs from a given EntityListIterator. It initializes an ArrayList to store the product IDs\nHow-it-is-done: This method retrieves a list of product IDs from a given EntityListIterator object. It initializes an ArrayList of String called productIds with a\nProperty: returns a list of product ids, each product id is the mainProductId of a GenericValue object returned by the EntityListIterator . The list is\n\n\n What: The change in the loop condition will affect the behavior of the function by modifying the condition under which the loop continues. The original loop continues as long as there are results in the EntityListIterator and the number of retrieved results is less than the maximum number of results (if specified). The modified loop continues as long as there are results in the EntityListIterator and there are still results to be retrieved (either because the maximum number of results has not been reached or because the loop has not yet reached the specified result offset).\n\nWhy: The change in the loop condition is intended to make the function more flexible in terms of the number of results that can be retrieved. The original loop would stop retrieving results once the maximum number of results was reached, even if there were more results available. The modified loop will continue retrieving results until it reaches the specified result offset, even if the maximum number of results has not been reached.\n\nHow-to-use: The usage of the function remains the same. It is still used to retrieve a list of product IDs from a given EntityListIterator.\n\nHow-it-is-done: The function will continue retrieving results from the EntityListIterator as long as there are results available and the modified loop condition is met. The modified loop condition will cause the function to continue retrieving results until it reaches the specified result offset, even if the maximum number of results has not been reached.\n\nProperty: The property of the function remains the same. It still returns a list of product ids, each product id is the mainProductId of a GenericValue object returned by the EntityListIterator. The list is still initialized with a maximum size of 100, unless a different maximum size is specified. The function still has pre-conditions that the EntityListIterator and the maximumResults (if specified) are not null. The function still has post-conditions that the function returns a list of product ids and the totalResults property is updated with the total number of results retrieved. The function still logs warnings and errors as appropriate.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe functionality of the modified classes remains the same before and after the changes.\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nHere is the associated pull request(s):\nThere is no pull request associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nANSWERING FORMAT AND INSTRUCTIONS\nYour commit message must be in the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"the type of the commit\",\n    \"subject\": \"the subject of the commit message\",\n    \"body\": \"the body of the commit message\"\n}\n```\n\n- The subject must be at most 72 characters.

It will open a sample Excel file, calculate the Excel date from a given calendar, round the Excel date to the nearest integer, convert the integer to a String, and then check the value of a specific cell in the Excel file with the modified String. The pre-condition for the function is that the `XSSFTestDataSamples` class is available and the sample Excel file \"56688_4.xlsx\" is present in the classpath.

The method `setExternalId(String id)` has been modified.\n\nIn the old version, the method sets the `id` to the `CTExternalData` object created by `getCTChartSpace().addNewExternalData()`.\n\nIn the new version, the method first checks if the `CTChartSpace` object has an existing `CTExternalData` object using `ctChartSpace.isSetExternalData()`. If it does, it assigns the existing `CTExternalData` object to the `externalData` variable. If not, it creates a new `CTExternalData` object and assigns it to the `externalData` variable.

This change is made to improve the robustness and flexibility of the `WebXml` class.\n\nHow-to-use: The usage of the method remains the same, but the test will now also check if the duplicate filter mappings are properly handled and replaced with a single, valid mapping.\n\nHow-it-is-done: The test will check that the web.xml configuration file does not contain duplicate filter mapping definitions, but it will also check that the duplicate mappings are properly handled and replaced with a single, valid mapping. This change is made by modifying the `WebXml` class to handle duplicate filter mappings and replace them with a single, valid mapping.\n\nProperty: The test will still check that the DuplicateMappingParamFilter is not added to the web.xml file when the annotations are processed, but it will also check that any duplicate filter mappings are properly replaced with a single, valid mapping. This change is made to ensure that the `WebXml` class behaves correctly when it encounters duplicate filter mappings in the configuration file.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe functionality of the modified classes remains the same before and after the changes.\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nHere is the associated pull request(s):\nThere is no pull request associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nANSWERING FORMAT AND INSTRUCTIONS\nYour commit message must be in the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"the type of the commit\",\n    \"subject\": \"the subject of the commit message\",\n    \"body\": \"the body of the commit message\"\n}\n```\n\n- The subject must be at most 72 characters.

The only change is that it will now handle a wider range of exceptions (Throwable instead of Exception) and use a different utility method (ExceptionUtils.handleThrowable instead of the default one) to handle those exceptions.\n\nWhy: The reason for the change is to make the method more robust and able to handle a wider range of errors that might occur during the execution of the method.\n\nHow-to-use: The usage of the method remains the same. It is used to list all the beans in the MBeanServer that match a given query.\n\nHow-it-is-done: The method will still iterate through the set of object names returned by the MBeanServer and print their attributes and values to a PrintWriter.

Instead of using `toString()`, it will use `toStringInternal()`.\n\nWhy: The reason for the change is not provided, but it could be to use a more efficient or secure method for converting the byte array to a string.\n\nHow-to-use: The usage of the method remains the same. It is still called when a request is made to the server, and it still checks if the user is already authenticated, if not it tries to reauthenticate the user.\n\nHow-it-is-done: The change will affect the internal implementation of the method, specifically the line where the base64 encoded username is converted to a string. Instead of using `toString()`, it will use `toStringInternal()`.\n\nProperty: The pre-condition of the method is that a request is made to the server.

The new regular expression for escaping single quotes is likely to handle cases where the string contains single quotes within single quotes.\n\nHow-to-use: The usage of the method remains the same, but the expected output may change due to the additional formatting rules.\n\nHow-it-is-done: The function will still escape newlines, tabs, and leading spaces, but it will also check for the presence of the pattern \"[{0}]\" and escape single quotes using a new regular expression.\n\nProperty: The method will still format a string by escaping newlines, tabs, and leading spaces, and removing any trailing backslashes.

Instead of using `uri.getSchemeSpecificPart()`, it will use `uri.getRawSchemeSpecificPart()`.\n\nWhy: The change is made to ensure that the URI scheme-specific part includes the query parameters if any.\n\nHow-to-use: The usage of the method remains the same. You still call the method with a class object as an argument and it returns the File object representing the location of the JAR file containing the class.\n\nHow-it-is-done: The function will still construct the class file name, retrieve the URL, and decode the URI path to a file path. However, the URI construction will be different, using `uri.getRawSchemeSpecificPart()` instead of `uri.getSchemeSpecificPart()`.\n\nProperty: The pre-condition is that the given class object is not null. The post-condition is that the method returns a File object representing the location of the JAR file containing the given class. The change in the URI construction does not affect the properties of the method.\n\nHere is the changed class(es) functionality summary:\nThe functionality of the modified classes remains the same before and after the changes.\n\n\nHere is the associated issue(s):\nThere is no issue report associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nHere is the associated pull request(s):\nThere is no pull request associated with this commit url (git diff)\n\nANSWERING FORMAT AND INSTRUCTIONS\nYour commit message must be in the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"the type of the commit\",\n    \"subject\": \"the subject of the commit message\",\n    \"body\": \"the body of the commit message\"\n}\n```\n\n- The subject must be at most 72 characters. It should contain a brief summary of the changes introduced by the commit. You must use **imperative mood** to write the subject in the present tense.

The type must be exactly one of the following: feat, fix, style, refactor.  No other values are acceptable. The definitions of these activities are given below:\nfeat: introducing NEW features into the system.
